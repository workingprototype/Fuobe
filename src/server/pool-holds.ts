/**
 * Runs on this install's GPUs that are made but wait to enter the line (hosted runs). One press of Run makes one run,
 * always: a press past a limit the run can wait out is taken, its tile shows at once ("In line"), and the run's GPU task
 * is made later, when the reason clears (pool-release.ts). Nothing here is read or written while hosted runs are off.
 *
 * Why a run waits (`reason`):
 * - `mine`: the account already has its runs at once in line (the policy's `activeRuns`); it enters when one of them ends.
 * - `today`: the day's GPU time is used up (the billing service's `startAt`); it enters at the renewal.
 * - `service`: the billing or moderation service didn't answer at the press (or said runs are paused); it reserves (and
 *   is checked) once the service answers.
 * - `hour`: an hourly limit; it enters at `start_at`.
 * - `list`: the waiting list (only when the service has one switched on).
 * - `credits`: no free generations left until they renew at `start_at` (credits on).
 *
 * Where it enters (`rank_rule`): a run held for the account's own reasons (mine, hour, list, credits) at the back of the
 * line when it is released, so ten fast presses never pass anyone; one held for the system's reasons (today, service)
 * at its press time.
 *
 * A hold row is kept for every row of the run (its jobs and the later steps of its chains), all sharing `run_id`, so the
 * runs' counts skip them and a deploy or a second app process sees them. `job` is the index of a row sent at release
 * (its seed's offset); a later step (null) waits for its earlier steps as it always does. `holder` and `lease_until`:
 * the app process releasing the run right now (pool-release.ts, run-leases.ts), so two processes never release one run
 * twice.
