/**
 * Admin tokens: an install can be managed from your own tools with an admin API token (docs/admin-api.md).
 *
 * A token (`fuobe_adm_` + 43 characters) works only on /api/admin (src/proxy.ts refuses it everywhere else), and only for
 * the scopes the owner ticked when making it in Settings → Security. It is never the owner: it can't sign in, open a
 * page, change settings or make tokens. A request that carries one is checked by the token alone (a session cookie beside
 * it is ignored). Only its SHA-256 is stored; the token itself is in the answer that made it and nowhere else.
 *
 * Every change made through the admin API (by the owner or a token) is written to admin_audit, and so are a token's
 * reads of people's data (coalesced), each file it views, and the refusals of a valid token. Never a token, a password,
 * a prompt or an IP address.
