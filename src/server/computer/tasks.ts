 * "Use the ComfyUI on this computer" (DESIGN.md): the server keeps each ComfyUI job of a run on someone's computer as a
 * task, and that person's Fuobe tab does it. A task holds the graph exactly as the server built it, the inputs it
 * staged (under names it chose), the prompt id it minted, and later the files it asks for. Tasks belong to a principal
 * ("owner", or "acct:<id>"), which every route takes from the session cookie, never from the request: one principal
 * can't see, take, read or fill another's task (an unknown or foreign task is a 404). A task is taken by one tab at a
 * time: each claim hands out a new lease, and every call about the task carries it. One computer at a time runs a
 * principal's waiting tasks (the runner, renewed by its beats); a task a computer took stays with that computer.
