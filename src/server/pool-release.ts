/**
 * The release loop of runs made but waiting to enter the line on this install's GPUs (pool-holds.ts). It runs in the
 * generations runner's turn (every app process, every 1.5 s), only while hosted runs are on and something waits:
 *
 * 1. A run waits until its `start_at` (the day's GPU time renews, an hourly limit, free generations renew).
 * 2. A run the billing or moderation service didn't answer for is checked and reserved, under its press's own request id
 *    (so a hold an unanswered try made at the press is the one it gets): tried again with a growing wait (1 s, doubling,
 *    at most 30 s), and at once after the service answers any call. An answer with a later start waits for it; a refusal
 *    ends the run in the service's words (its tile says it plainly).
 * 3. It enters when the account has room among its runs going (the policy's runs at once and in line), its presses in the
 *    order they were made; a run that counted already (one cut off by a deploy or a crash) needs no room.
 * 4. It enters the line at its press time (the system's reasons) or at the back (the account's own), and its rows are
 *    sent from what is stored, as a run is sent again after its GPU lost it.
 *
 * Each run is leased to one app process while it is released (pool-holds.ts leaseRun), so two processes during a deploy
 * never release one run twice, and a process that stops mid-way leaves it to the other once its lease ends.
