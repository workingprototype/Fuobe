 * this install's GPUs (the "pool" place). With the switch off, nothing here is used and accounts run as before: on
 * their own GPU or their own key only.
 *
 * Where an account's run goes (the generations route):
 * 1. the account asked for its own GPU, or its own GPU is online and it didn't ask for this install's → its own GPU;
 * 2. a paid model and its own key → its own key;
 * 3. hosted runs are on, the model runs on ComfyUI, and the policy allows it → this install's GPUs, with a billing hold
 *    when a billing service is set (billing.ts), free otherwise;
 * 4. otherwise today's answer ("Connect your GPU", "Add your key").
 *
 * This install's GPUs are its workers (Settings: ComfyUI runs on "workers", docs/gpu-workers.md): each job of the run is
 * a task for them, in one line with every other, and nothing reaches a ComfyUI address from here. Otherwise its own
 * ComfyUI server (Settings → ComfyUI address), only when that is on this machine. An install whose ComfyUI is on the
 * owner's computer (a browser tab) doesn't offer hosted runs: that computer is the owner's alone.
 *
 * Runs here need someone to answer for them: a billing service (billing.ts), whose policy then says who may run what;
 * or FUOBE_HOSTED_FREE=1, which says this install's runs are free for every account (within its own limits). With
 * neither, hosted runs stay closed even when switched on.
