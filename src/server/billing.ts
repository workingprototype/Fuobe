/**
 * The billing hook (docs/billing-hook.md): an install can connect an external billing service at FUOBE_BILLING_URL.
 * Fuobe sends facts about each run that goes to this install's GPUs (hosted runs, hosted.ts); the service answers with
 * what the person sees and whether the run may start. With no service set, no call is made and every run is free and
 * allowed: exactly the studio as it was.
 *
 * The service is called only for runs on this install's GPUs ("pool"), plus an account's policy, its balance, account
 * events and offer clicks. A run on the account's own GPU or its own key never asks it.
 *
 * Calls: GET /v1/policy, POST /v1/quote, POST /v1/reserve, POST /v1/release, POST /v1/settle, POST /v1/refund,
 * GET /v1/balance, POST /v1/account-event, POST /v1/interest. Every call is safe to send twice. Release, settle and
 * refund go through an outbox (billing-outbox.ts), so they reach the service even after a restart or an outage.
