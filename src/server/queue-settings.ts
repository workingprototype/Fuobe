/**
 * The line's install-wide settings (the owner's, through GET and PATCH /api/admin/queue/settings; docs/admin-api.md):
 *
 * - `runCeilingS`: the longest one attempt at a job on this install's GPUs may run, in seconds: a default, and a value
 *   per lane that overrides it. It ends the generation's own clock and is the most a worker's run limit may be.
 * - `ownerWaitLimitS`: how long the owner's own jobs on the workers may wait in line before a worker first takes them
 *   (null: no limit). People's runs go first, so the owner's jobs can wait a long time.
 * - `fairShare`: off, the line goes strictly by class, then by when each job came. On, an account's (or the owner's)
 *   next job goes after every other account's job that came before it and is the first of its own.
 * - `pickAllowanceMs`: how long a job in the lane a worker has loaded may go ahead of an older one in another lane, so a
 *   worker doesn't reload its models for every job (0: strict order).
 * - `firstPickGraceMs`: how long a job may wait for a worker with a higher pick order to take it, while that worker is
 *   free and can run it, before another worker takes it (0: no job waits for one).
 * - `pausedBudgetS`: how long, in all, a run that has started may spend back in line while its worker steps aside (another
 *   program on its GPU, a pause) and still be inside its hold's deadline. With the run ceiling, it sets the time a run
 *   asks its hold to stay open (holdTiming). A run past it still delivers its result.
 *
 * Kept in the settings table under one key, as JSON. Nothing set: the defaults, which are today's fixed values.
