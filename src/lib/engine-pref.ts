 * Hosted runs off (every self-hosted install by default), and the owner: one switch for the browser, `fuobe.engine`,
 * starting on Cloud, as always. While runs can go to the install's own GPUs (`viewer.hosted`), open models run free
 * there, so the switch starts on Open source: each account keeps its own (a second account on the same browser keeps
 * its own too), starting on Cloud only when the account picked its key as the place for its runs (`runOn` "key"). A
 * guest keeps one for the browser. Saving a key never moves it.
