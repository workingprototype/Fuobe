/**
 * Fuobe's guard for ComfyUI: one small custom node file that keeps every other website out while ComfyUI runs with
 * Fuobe's setting (--enable-cors-header <this site>). ComfyUI replaces its own cross-site check with that setting, so
 * without the guard any website the browser lets reach this computer could queue work on it, upload into it or stop it
 * (it couldn't read the answers). The guard puts the check back for every site but the one the setting names: a request
 * from a web page gets in only when the page is ComfyUI's own (same host) or that site. A program (no browser headers)
 * gets in as before, and so does every page while ComfyUI runs without the setting (ComfyUI's own check is on then). It
 * also answers GET /fuobe/guard, so the Fuobe tab can tell it is there.
 *
 * The Windows start file writes it into ComfyUI's custom_nodes folder; the other installs download it from the card.
 * Plain ASCII (the start file carries it as base64). Pure: the card, the start file and the tests share it.

Started with --enable-cors-header, ComfyUI lets the website it names use it from your browser, but it also stops
turning away requests from every other website. This file puts that check back: a request from a web page gets in only
when the page is ComfyUI's own or the site the setting names. Programs (no browser) get in as before, and nothing
changes while ComfyUI runs without the setting. It adds no nodes, reads no files and sends nothing anywhere.
To remove it, delete this file and restart ComfyUI.
