/**
 * Which tile of a picker plays its clip (cover-tile.tsx: the camera motion and Mix grids, Cinema Studio's moves). One
 * at a time: the tile hovered or keyboard-focused, once it has had the pointer for a moment (HOVER_INTENT, as in the
 * galleries), or the row a list highlights; while there is none, the picked tile. Unlike a gallery, nothing plays for
 * being in view: a picker shows dozens of tiles at once.
 *
 * The picked tile plays unasked, so not with Save-Data or on 2G, and only once no other tile has played for
 * PICKED_RESUME (moving the pointer from tile to tile doesn't restart it each time). Nothing plays when the user
 * prefers reduced motion.
 *
 * Pure apart from the environment it's given, so the rules are testable without a browser.
