 * Fuobe FX: the tools a VFX artist or team reaches for, grouped by the stage of an FX pipeline they serve. Pure data, so

 * mega-menus.server.ts resolve the ids to covers and links.
 *
 * Fuobe FX is the one home of the FX studios (FX_HOME): they have no launcher group, so Studios and /create list them
 * no more, and their cards are here. Each section's cards are those studios and their own modes; the shared tools FX
 * work also uses (Upscale, Color grading, Layers, Inpaint, Image to 3D…) and the one-click apps keep their homes and
 * are pills here. Every item is a navigation entry's id (src/lib/nav-model.ts) or an app's preset id ("app-…").
