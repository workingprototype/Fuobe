 * The Audio hub's Loop / extend and Join tools (r4/faceless-plus): plain data and the planner shared by the
 * page and the server (src/server/audio-tools.ts), which turns a plan into one createPipeline batch.
 *
 * - Open engine (ComfyUI, CPU): one job each — audio-loop-crossfade extends a clip to any length up to
 *   10 minutes with a crossfade at every seam and a fade-out; audio-join-crossfade joins up to 10 clips with a
 *   crossfade at every seam. The provider writes the fade curve.
 * - Cloud (fal merge-audios): whole plays and hard joins, 2–5 files a call, so longer loops and joins of
 *   more clips run as a chain of calls. A loop comes out a whole number of plays long.
