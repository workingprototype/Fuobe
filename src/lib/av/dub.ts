/**
 * Translate & dub, planned as plain data (client and server). Two ways to dub:
 *
 * - One shot (cloud): HeyGen Translate or ElevenLabs Dubbing take the video and return it dubbed.
 * - Step by step (both engines), as two pipelines with a review in between:
 *     prepare: voice stem (+ background on the open engine) → timed transcript → translation per language
 *     review:  the person edits the translated lines (nothing is spoken yet)
 *     voice:   speech in the cloned voice → lips re-synced → the new voice over the background
 *
 * The new voice follows the reviewed timing: the lines are grouped into phrases (lines less than
 * PHRASE_GAP apart are spoken in one take), each phrase is spoken on its own and placed at its cue's
 * start on a silent track exactly as long as the source (the "timeline" step), so pauses are kept, the
 * lip re-sync covers the whole clip and the dubbed video is as long as the original.
 *
 * Open engine: MelBand RoFormer splits voice and background and Qwen3-ASR 1.7B times the voice stem, in
 * one job (oss-voice-separate); the local LLM translates the cues (oss-text-llm); Chatterbox Multilingual
 * speaks each phrase in the cloned voice; the audio-timeline workflow lays them out; InfiniteTalk
 * re-syncs the lips and the mux mixes the voice over the background stem.
 * Cloud: ElevenLabs Voice Isolation (the clean voice to clone), Scribe v2 on it (transcript), Claude or
 * Ollama (translation), and in parallel the source's sound split by Demucs (drums, bass and other: the
 * music and effects). ElevenLabs v4 speaks each phrase, fal's compose lays them out over a blank still
 * (its soundtrack is read back as audio), Chatterbox voice conversion turns the track into the speaker's
 * voice and Sync Lipsync 3 re-syncs the lips; compose then mixes the new voice over the Demucs stems and
 * that mix replaces the video's sound. Like the open mux, the background sits BACKGROUND_DB under its
 * original level: fal's compose has no volume control, so each stem is lowered first by fal's loudnorm
 * in linear mode (see linearGain). Dubs started before the background split, or whose split failed (or
 * found nothing but the voice), carry the dubbed voice only.
