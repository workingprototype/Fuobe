/**
 * How far a ComfyUI job is, from what its socket reports (each node that starts, and the steps of a node that has
 * them), as one share from 0 to 0.99 that every place showing the run reads: its card, the studio feeds, the Library,
 * the API and the admin.
 *
 * Most of a job's time is its sampler's steps, while the sampler is one node of many, so the share of nodes run says
 * little: a graph whose loaders and encoders run first reads three quarters done before its first step. Here the bar has
 * stages instead:
 *
 * - getting ready (its models loading, its prompt encoding): a small share that grows slowly with time, at most
 *   PROGRESS_BANDS.ready;
 * - sampling: most of the bar, by the steps of each sampler pass the graph has (in the order they run), and between two
 *   steps by the time a step takes;
 * - finishing (decoding, sound, saving the files on the GPU): the next few percent, by the nodes after the sampler;
 * - collecting (the results coming to the studio): the last percent.
 *
 * The share never passes 0.99 before the run is done; the server keeps the highest share shown in one try (`shown`), so
 * it never moves backwards there. A new try starts again from its own first stage.
 *
 * Pure: the server and the tests share it.
