 * The words for a run's place in line on this install's GPUs (hosted runs). Before Run, the line under the toolbar says

 * run's tile says where it is and when ("You're next · ready in about 40 s", "2 ahead of you · about 3 min"). A run shows
 * only its place, "Working", then its result: it is taken whatever the line, and never ends for a wait.
 *
 * A run can also be made and wait to enter the line (`held`): behind the account's other runs ("After your other runs"),
 * until a time ("Free runs refresh at 14:20." before Run, "Free runs refresh at 14:20 · this one starts then" on its
 * tile), or while runs there are paused ("Warming up · starts automatically").
 *
 * The words are friendly and say what happens next: never the machinery (a GPU, a worker, a queue), never "busy", never
 * "try again later" (tests/hosted-words.test.ts). They are made in the browser, so a time is the viewer's own clock.
 * A few of them are the service's display copy when it sends some (src/lib/service-copy.ts), else the plain ones here.
