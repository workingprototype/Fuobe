/**
 * Video tools → Remove object: say what goes by typing it ("the coffee cup"), clicking it on the first
 * frame, or painting over it. Higgsfield runs this as Edit Video with a removal prompt on Kling O3 Omni;
 * Fuobe adds Bria's clicked / masked eraser, VOID for shadows and reflections, and the open engine's
 * SAM 3.1 + Wan 2.1 VACE (or VOID) graphs.
 *
 * Every eraser takes a short clip (Bria under 5 s, Kling 3–15 s, VOID 197 frames, the open graphs 81 or
 * 197 frames per window), so longer clips are cut into pieces, erased and joined, and the clip's own sound
 * is put back. Pure module (erasers per engine and mode, pieces and windows, prompts, the pipeline's steps),
 * shared by the page, the server (src/server/remove-object.ts) and the tests.
 * Research: docs/research/higgsfield-delta-4.md §4.1, paid-model-apis-4.md §3 and §10, comfyui-oss-4.md §b.
