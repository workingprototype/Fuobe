 *
 * - Fuobe Angles: Qwen-Image-Edit 2509 with dx8152's Multiple-angles LoRA. fal's hosted route takes the camera as
 *   fields (rotate, vertical angle, move forward, wide-angle) and writes the LoRA's words itself; on the GPU Fuobe
 *   writes them ({@link anglesWords}), the instructions the LoRA was trained on, in Chinese with English.
 * - Fuobe Speak: InfiniteTalk with Higgsfield's Infinite Talk settings on the GPU (the FusioniX LoRA, 15 motion
 *   frames, 25 steps, shift 10, text and audio guidance 5, colour correction), fal's InfiniteTalk in the cloud.
 *   Fuobe Speak · Motion is Wan 2.2 S2V on both engines (a Speak v1-like route: the body and the scene move).
 * - The face mosaic (Fuobe Soul's PixeletedFace look): SAM 3.1 finds the faces, a mosaic covers them. On the GPU one
 *   graph does both; in the cloud fal's SAM 3.1 answers with the masks and the server pixelates under them (the browser,
 *   for a picture the server can't decode).
