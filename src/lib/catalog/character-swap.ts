/**
 * Genjutsu's Character swap (Openjutsu and Akatz Labs' H3 Character Swap tool, docs/research/openjutsu-6.md): the person
 * in a 5–15 s part of a clip becomes the character in one image, keeping the performance, the scene and the clip's own
 * sound. On your GPU it is MiniMax H3 with Akatz Labs' Character Swap LoRA on the h3_character_swap node pack (SAM 3.1
 * finds the person on the part's first frame and H3 regenerates only them, in 124-frame windows with 18 frames of
 * history); in the cloud it is fal's MiniMax H3 reference-to-video with the same LoRA (no mask: who to swap is said in
 * words). An optional "anchor" first frame (the part's first frame with the character already in it, made by an image
 * edit) starts the swap off right; when it can't be made the swap runs without it.
 *
 * Pure module: limits, prompts, the H3 window plan, who to swap, the anchor's prompt and models, licences as data.
 * The prompts follow Openjutsu's (MIT, Comfy Org 2026) and Akatz Labs' anchor brief (MIT, Akatz Labs 2026).
