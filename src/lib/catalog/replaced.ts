/**
 * What replaced each retired model, look and training target when Fuobe stopped calling Higgsfield's API (build plan O7,
 * docs/research/fuobe-originals-recipes-5.md, "What replaces each Higgsfield model when the provider is removed").
 *
 * One way only: an id stored before the switch — a past generation's Reuse, a saved Cinema or Canvas project, an Assist
 * plan, a Genjutsu setup code, a Katana job, a moodboard pick, a training — resolves here to the model that does the job
 * now, a Fuobe Original where there is one, else a partner model on fal or Replicate. Nothing here is ever sent to a
 * provider. Past generations stay viewable as they are: the Library reads their saved outputs, not a provider.
 *
 * Soul's old style ids resolve to Fuobe looks through lookCard() (each look keeps the id it replaces, never sent);
 * Genjutsu's old looks are dropped (a Soul look or your own images replace them).
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe (cards only, no recipes); shared by the browser and the server. tests/no-higgsfield.test.ts checks every target exists.
