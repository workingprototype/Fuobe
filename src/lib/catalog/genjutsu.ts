/**
 * Fuobe Genjutsu (build plan O5): keep a clip's motion, camera and framing, change what is in it. Five modes: Motion
 * transfer (your character does what the clip's person does), Character swap (the person in a 5–15 s part becomes your
 * character, sound and performance kept: Openjutsu / Akatz Labs' H3 Character Swap), Object swap (a thing, a person or
 * an outfit becomes your reference), Restyle (every frame takes a look) and Insert (your reference is added where you
 * say). Each mode's default is a Fuobe Original — open weights on your GPU (ComfyUI) and hosted models on fal in the
 * cloud: Wan Animate 2 for motion on your GPU and MiniMax H3 Max Recast in the cloud (fal's successor to Wan 2.2 Animate),
 * MiniMax H3 + the Character Swap LoRA for characters, SAM 3.1 + Wan VACE for swaps, a restyled first frame + Wan Fun VACE
 * for looks. Lite is the cheaper, faster tier of the same Original. Other hosted open models (SCAIL-2, Wan Motion, hosted
 * Wan 2.2 VACE) and partner models (Kling, P-Video, H3 Max Recast, Gemini Omni, Happy Horse) stay as labelled
 * alternatives. No retired provider's model or look.
 *
 * Every model takes a part of the clip (Kling 3–15 s, VACE 81 or 241 frames, H3 5–15 s…), so longer selections are cut
 * into pieces or windows, made one by one, joined, and the clip's own sound put back (the remove-object plumbing). Pure
 * module (models per mode and engine, limits, prompts, prices, the pipeline's steps and the shareable setup code),
 * shared by the page, the server (src/server/genjutsu.ts) and the tests.
 * Research: docs/research/fuobe-originals-recipes-5.md §8 genjutsu and O5, openjutsu-6.md, paid-model-apis-4.md §4,
 * comfyui-oss-4.md §c.
