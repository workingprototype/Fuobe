/*
 * Faceless Studio and the Explainer: the data and the pure planning shared by the browser (wizard,
 * script review, timeline editor) and the server (src/server/faceless.ts).
 *
 * Research: docs/research/higgsfield-marketing-agents.json → faceless (4 genres, 12 styles, 1–5 min,
 * Fully animated / Frame by frame, 16:9 / 9:16, ≤3 style references, ≤5,000-character topics, ≤12,000-character
 * scripts, 10-second blocks) and → explainer (22 styles, Auto / 20 s … 10 min / Manual 15–600 s, ≤3 sources).
 * tests/faceless.test.ts checks the copies against the JSON. The style prompts are Fuobe's own words.
 *
 * An episode is a list of blocks (one scene each, ≤10 s). Rendering builds one graph of chained generations:
 *
 *   still(b) ──► clip(b, s)… ──► join (folded) ──► mix ◄── narration, music ──► captions ──► final
 *
 * - still: a picture per block in the episode's style (Nano Banana Pro / Z-Image Turbo; with style
 *   references Nano Banana Pro edit / Qwen-Image-Edit Style Reference).
 * - clip: the still animated (Gemini Omni Flash, Higgsfield's engine, or Seedance 2.5 / Wan 2.2 Lightning).
 *   Frame by frame keeps the still and moves the camera slowly over it with no video model: a real Ken Burns
 *   (src/lib/av/ken-burns.ts) — fal's image-to-video zooms in and out by turns on the cloud; ComfyUI's
 *   kenburns-still zooms and pans on the open engine, at most 10 s a job, so longer scenes are split into
 *   pieces of one move, joined packet by packet with the others (video-concat-encoded).
 * - narration: the whole reviewed script read in one take (one natural voice-over; ElevenLabs v4, or
 *   Chatterbox cloning a voice sample), then timed word by word (ElevenLabs forced alignment on the cloud,
 *   Qwen3-ASR on the open engine).
 * - The render runs in two stages: the pictures, the narration and its timing first; then each block is
 *   cut to where its lines really fall (retimeBlocks) and the clips, joins, music, mix and subtitles follow,
 *   so picture and voice stay together over the whole film, whatever pace the narrator reads at.
 * - music: an instrumental bed (Sonilo / ACE-Step) as long as the film, mixed under the voice: fal's compose
 *   with the bed levelled to -28 LUFS on the cloud, oss-mux at -14 dB on the open engine. A film longer than
 *   the music model makes (ACE-Step: 240 s; Sonilo: 600 s) loops the bed: crossfaded seams on the open engine
 *   (audio-loop-crossfade, up to 600 s), whole plays on the cloud (merge-audios; the mix cuts it to the film).
 * - captions: Auto Subtitle on the cloud; Qwen3-ASR timings + the open burn-in on the open engine.
