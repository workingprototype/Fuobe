/*
 * Cinema Studio 4.0 as a Fuobe Original (build plan O6): the director's data and the pure planning step
 * shared by the browser (live cost, previews) and the server (src/server/cinema-generate.ts). No Higgsfield
 * API: everything runs on open weights (Fuobe Cinema, Fuobe Soul) or on partner models through fal / Replicate.
 *
 * Everything below the "Research data" line is copied from docs/research/higgsfield-studios.json →
 * cinemaStudio (genres, eras, tempos, camera bodies, lenses, apertures, the 33 camera moves, the 50 public
 * palettes with their 12 hex colours, the 7 lighting presets, the Emotion Wheel), higgsfield-image-studios.json
 * → characterSheet.soulCast (the 17 Soul Cast fields) and fuobe-originals-recipes-5.json →
 * studios[cinema-studio].original (Fuobe Cinema's recipe: which camera LoRA each move takes, the longest take).
 * tests/cinema.test.ts checks the copy against the JSON, so a research update shows up as a failing test.
 *
 * Routes:
 * - Video: Fuobe Cinema (`fuobe-cinema`) with the Director's Panel compiled into the prompt. In the cloud it is
 *   LTX-2.3 22B on fal: a move LTX-2.3's camera LoRA makes goes as `camera_lora`; a move with a Wan 2.2 LoRA runs on
 *   Fuobe DoP (Wan 2.2 A14B) when there is a start frame; Rack Focus is LTX-2.5's focus shift; the rest are words. A
 *   take longer than 20 s adds the rest with one extend. On the user's GPU it is Wan 2.2 14B Lightning: the move's
 *   Wan LoRA or a Fun Camera pose (both need a start frame), then a palette-transfer step when a palette is set.
 *   Seedance 2.5, Kling 3.0 and Veo 3.1 stay pickable with everything in the prompt.
 * - Stills: Fuobe Soul Cinema. Soul Cast and Soul Location: Fuobe Soul with a look, other views of a location by
 *   the Multiple-Angles LoRA.
