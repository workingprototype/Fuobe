/**
 * Character Swap Studio (/character-swap): Akatz Labs' H3 Character Swap workbench for whole clips, on both engines
 * (docs/research/openjutsu-6.md §4.2, the Akatz app's modes and options). A project holds clips and one character
 * (a reference image and a written description). Each clip is cut into shots at its edits; a shot is either swapped
 * ("Replace character") or kept as filmed ("Keep original"). A swapped shot runs as segments of one diffusion pass each
 * (at most 362 frames with its continuation boundary), each with its own dialogue, speaker, prompt, seed, a fresh start
 * or a continuation of the segment before it, and an anchor. Segments make takes; the chosen takes are laid over the
 * original timeline with the original sound.
 *
 * This module is the pure part, shared by the page, the server (src/server/swap-studio.ts) and the tests: the project
 * document and its defaults, shots from cuts, transcript words and speakers, the performance prompts, segment layouts
 * and their continuation dependencies, take and review state, mask point payloads and the assembly order. The engine
 * steps are in swap-studio-plan.ts. Behaviour follows Akatz Labs' app (MIT, Akatz Labs 2026); its prompts are reused
 * with that notice. No code of theirs is copied.
