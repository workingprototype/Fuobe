/**
 * Prompt packs for the image studios (docs/research/higgsfield-image-studios.md §2, §3, §6, §7):
 * Photodump / Instadump packs, Fashion Factory templates, Character Sheet prompts, the drawn covers' hues and
 * tones, and the pure planning steps that turn them into generation requests.
 *
 * Catalog-free on purpose: the pages import it in the browser. What depends on the catalog or
 * the install (the models it has) comes in as `PlanCaps`; the server (src/server/photodump.ts)
 * fills those in and validates every request before creating it.
 *
 * Pack names, photo counts and template shot counts come from the generated research file
 * (studio-packs.generated.ts); the per-photo prompts are Fuobe's own. tests/image-studios.test.ts
 * checks that every pack has exactly as many prompts as its photo count.
