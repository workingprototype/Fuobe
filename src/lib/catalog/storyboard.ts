/**
 * Storyboards (Higgsfield Popcorn): up to 8 consistent frames. Frame 1 is made from the
 * references (or text alone); every later frame is an edit of the previous frame, so faces,
 * wardrobe, location and grade carry through.
 *
 * Since build plan O13 a board can take one of Fuobe Soul's looks (research §8 popcorn): frame 1
 * is made on Fuobe Soul with the look on either engine (with references it stays on the reference
 * model, with the look's words), the next frames carry the look's words, and every frame gets the
 * look's grade and overlay after it is made (each next frame is made from the previous one as it
 * came out, so the grade is applied once).
 *
 * The board is Fuobe's open recipe on both engines: Qwen-Image-Edit 2509 + the next-scene LoRA makes each next frame
 * on your GPU (a graph that loads it) and on fal's hosted Qwen-Image-Edit 2509 (the LoRA sent as a URL). Nano Banana
 * Pro stays a separate choice in the cloud (`partner`), every frame on it as boards ran before.
