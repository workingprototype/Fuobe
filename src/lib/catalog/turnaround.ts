/**
 * Turnaround video (build plan N7-6; research new-models-7.md §3.7 recipes (B) and (C), §3.10 row 2): one click on a cast
 * sheet or a saved character makes a 360° turnaround of the same person, on both engines, with routes Fuobe already has.
 *
 * - The views: the person's front, right side, back and left side (their own left and right, as Image to 3D's side picker
 *   names them), filmed in that order and back to the front. Sides nobody has a picture of are drawn first from the front
 *   view by the Angles app's route (the Multiple-Angles LoRA); a sheet with no front view gets one drawn from it.
 * - Open engine: Frames mode's chain (Wan 2.2 14B start / end-frame clips, src/server/chains.ts createKeyframeFilm) with
 *   the views at 0, ¼, ½, ¾ and the end of the clip, and the orbit words.
 * - Cloud: MiniMax H3 Max reference-to-video with the views as Image 1…n (recipe C), FLUX 3 Max keyframes-to-video with
 *   the views at their quarters (recipe B), or, from the front view alone, H3 Max camera controls on an exact path (A).
 *
 * N7-9 later puts WorldCast behind the same buttons on the open engine; its side names and angles are written down here.
 * Pure: the browser prices it live, the server runs the same steps (src/server/turnaround.ts, Cinema's "turnaround").
