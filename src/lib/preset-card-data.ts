/**
 * A preset's card as the galleries and the preset header show it: the slim card data (preset-cards.ts) with
 * its real cover when it has one (preset-previews.generated.ts, pnpm eval:covers), else the procedural preview.
 *
 * The only module that reads the covers manifest, which lists every cover with its provenance. Import it from
 * server pages, or from a component loaded on its own (next/dynamic, like the preset header): a client module
 * that imports it ships the whole manifest in every chunk it is in. tests/preset-cards.test.ts checks the importers.
