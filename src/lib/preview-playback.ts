/**
 * Which gallery previews play (preset-preview.tsx). A card with a clip plays by itself while it's
 * mostly in view, once scrolling has stopped: the cards most in view and nearest the middle of the
 * screen, at most MAX_PLAYING at once, so a gallery with dozens of clips stays smooth and doesn't
 * download them all. Procedural previews (no clip) play by themselves only where nothing can hover
 * (phones); a still never moves. Nothing plays by itself when the user prefers reduced motion, asks
 * for less data (Save-Data, a 2G connection) or the tab is hidden; reduced motion turned on while the
 * page is open stops what plays by itself at once. The viewer can pause previews too (Home's "Pause previews"): then
 * nothing plays by itself, anywhere.
 *
 * The hovered or focused card plays too, on top of those, once the pointer has rested on it for a
 * moment (a pointer crossing the grid doesn't start every card it passes); asked for, it plays even
 * with Save-Data, and a clip even with reduced motion (playsWhenAsked).
 *
 * Pure apart from the environment it's given, so the rules are testable without a browser.
