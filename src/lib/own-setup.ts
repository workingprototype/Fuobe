 *   that needs nodes or files this studio's GPU doesn't have, a feature that opens on this studio's GPU once a real
 *   render passes (`passes`: gpu-tested.json), and the hosted routes no live call has passed yet (hosted-untested.ts).
 * - The dynamic cases (no worker holds the model right now, a lane not served) are the hosted-run rules' (pool-rules.ts),
 *   which answer in this same shape.
 *
 * Pure (client and server): no server imports. Catalog files must not import this file (it reads the catalog): they
