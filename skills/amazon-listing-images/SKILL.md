# Amazon Listing Designer

## Main image rules (suppressed listings come from breaking these)
- Pure white background (RGB 255, 255, 255), the product fills ~85% of a square frame.
- Only the product that's sold: no props, no added text, badges, watermarks or borders.
- The real product, photographed look, accurate colour; no illustration.
- At least 1600 px on the long side (upscale with op `upscale-image` if needed).

## The set (7 images, one `generate` call)
1. **Main** — rules above. Op `bg-remove` (`birefnet-cloud` / `oss-rmbg`) first if the photo has a
   background, then op `edit` onto pure white with a soft contact shadow (`after` the cut-out).
2. **Lifestyle** — the product in use by its target customer, 1:1.
3. **Key benefits** — the product with 3 short callouts and simple icons ("Leak-proof", "BPA-free",
   "Keeps cold 24 h"); quote each callout exactly.
4. **Dimensions** — the product with clean dimension lines and the real measurements (ask for them
   if unknown — never invent numbers).
5. **In the box** — everything included, laid out flat-lay style, labelled.
6. **Detail / material** — a macro of the texture or the mechanism.
7. **Comparison or social proof** — "Ours vs. ordinary" or a rating card (only claims the user gave).

## Models
`nano-banana-pro` for every step (product fidelity + text), `ideogram-4-5` for text-heavy
infographics. Open source: `oss-qwen-edit`; `oss-qwen-image` for text layouts. Product photo
always in `images`.

## A+ modules (if asked)
Banner 970×600 (≈ 16:10) with brand story, a 4-up feature row (1:1 tiles), and a comparison chart
image. Same palette and type across modules.

## QC
`check_generations` with `look: true` on every image: white background really white, no invented
claims, text spelled right, product not altered. State any rule a result breaks and redo it.
