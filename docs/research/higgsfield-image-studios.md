# Higgsfield image studios: Layers, Photodump, Fashion Factory, Moodboards, Soul HEX, Soul presets, Character Sheet, Soul Location

_As of 2026-10-17. Machine-readable twin: [`higgsfield-image-studios.json`](higgsfield-image-studios.json). Builds on [`higgsfield-inventory.md`](higgsfield-inventory.md) §2.1, §2.3, §6.1 and replaces the rows there marked "unknown"/"low"._

> **Method.** Same approach as the inventory, pushed further. (1) Crawled the **whole production bundle graph** of the TanStack SPA (8,020 chunks from `assets.higgsfield.ai/tanstack/assets/`), so the lazily loaded editor screens (Layers, HEX panel, Photodump and Fashion Factory flows, Character Sheet) are covered, not just the SSR'd ones. (2) Pulled the **complete English UI catalog** `/_i18n/en.dd219392ea.json` (36,878 strings; the per-route catalogs miss strings that live in lazy chunks) plus all 266 route catalogs listed in `/_i18n/routes/index.en.json`, and resolved every message id a screen uses. (3) Called the **public, unauthenticated JSON endpoints the app itself uses** (`fnf-api-gw.higgsfield.ai/fnf/*`, `cms.higgsfield.ai/*`), which return the real preset, pack, template and palette lists with ids and exact hex values. (4) SSR of the 100 `/soul/<id>` preset pages, the Help Center, blog posts, and third-party searches. (5) For Fuobe's routes: Hugging Face, the official ComfyUI `workflow_templates` repo and fal OpenAPI.
>
> **Confidence.** Copy, option lists, limits, defaults, step order, request fields and credit formulas below are **exact** (read from code or API responses). Spatial layout (left/right/top) is **(inferred)** from component structure. One-line descriptions that Higgsfield does not publish are written by us and flagged `inferred` in the JSON (`descriptionSource`). Logged-in screens were not observed directly.

**What changed vs. the inventory (headline findings)**

* **Layers is Seedream 5.0 Pro layer separation** (landing badge "Powered by Seedream 5.0"; `/seedream-layer-separation` 301 → `/layers`). Settings are **Resolution 1K / 1.5K / 2K, Mode Standard / Fast, Layers 3–16 (default 8)**; cost **1.5 credits per layer (1K, 1.5K) or 3 per layer (2K)**. The editor is a full **tool shell with 11 image tools** (Layer Decomposition, Upscale, Color Grading, Enhancer, Relight, Inpaint, Regional Editing, Remove background, Angles, Edit text, Expand & Crop). The two zips are exactly specified (§1.7).
* **Open-source route exists and is official in ComfyUI:** **Qwen-Image-Layered** (Apache-2.0, Dec 2025, variable and recursive decomposition), with templates `image_qwen_image_layered` and the prompt-guided `image_qwen_image_layered_control`. ComfyUI also ships an API node for the paid route (`ByteDanceSeedreamLayerSeparationNodeV2`).
* **Photodump is three products:** legacy Photodump Studio (Soul v1, 26 shots, Sep 2025), **Soul 2.0 Photodump** (9 packs, 10–17 shots each, needs a Soul ID), and **Instadump** (one selfie, no training, 10 credits, packs incl. community packs). The old inventory's "12 or 26": 26 is the legacy set; 12 matches the Candid Glow, Surreal Self and Alter ego packs _(inferred; the inventory did not record its source for 12)_.
* **Fashion Factory has 6 templates** (Ultra bold, Blue-Green Gradient, Street style Paparazzi, View from the top, Light blue studio, Red room) and a 5-step flow: template → character → pick base (Soul, 4 shots at 3:4) → outfit (Nano Banana) → photoset (Nano Banana batch).
* **Moodboards: min 5, max 80 images, ≥256 px, name ≤100 chars**; a moodboard is a trained custom reference (`soul-v2-preset`). 21 curated moodboards in 3 groups (Mood / Styles / Camera) + 12 newer uncategorised presets.
* **Soul HEX palettes = the 50 Cinema Studio 4.0 palettes, with exact hex** (12 colours each; the 12th is also the background colour). They map 1:1 onto the `color_palette` enum Fuobe already has for Cinema Studio 4.0. The older names (Film colors, Lime Jam…) are gone from the API. Manual editor: max **12 colours** (10 on Recraft), defaults `#FFFFFF #D1FE17 #1C1E20` on `#53C546`, EyeDropper, 4 random palettes; from images: up to **20 photos**.
* **Soul presets:** Soul v1 has **106** presets (100 with public pages) in **8 categories: New, TikTok Core, Instagram Aesthetics, Camera Presets, Beauty, Mood, Surreal, Graphic Art** (+ All, + a feature-flagged "Dump"). The style ids are the same ids the public API takes as `style_id`, so Fuobe can ship them as a static fallback.
* **Costs:** Soul 2.0, Soul Cast, Soul Location and Soul Cinema Studio images are **0.125 credits each**; Edit text detection 0.5; Instadump 10.

## 1. Layers (`/layers`, `/layers/$projectId[/$versionId]`)

### 1.1 What it is
"Turn flat images into editable layers. Separate, edit, and rebuild any image. Every element, now yours to edit." A project = one source image + a layer document (nodes with `type: image`, `layerIndex`, `name`, `geometry {x, y, width, height, rotation}`, a `source`, optional mask) + versions. Landing (`/higgsfield-layers`): "Turn any flat image into editable layers - move, retype, relight, upscale", feature cards Layer Separation, Edit text, Regional edit; toolkit Draw to Edit, Remove Background, Upscale, Relight, Skin enhancer; FAQ "Layer Separation and AI region edits are available on paid plans and use credits", JPG/PNG/WebP up to 4K.

### 1.2 Projects screen (`/layers`)
| region | content |
|---|---|
| Hero | "Turn flat images / into editable layers." + capability carousel **Relight · Inpaint · Layer Decomposition · Edit text · Effects** (Previous / Next capability) |
| Upload | **Upload Media** — "Upload an image, or pick one you already generated. Images only — JPG, PNG, WebP or HEIC." Assets picker tabs: All Generations, Image Generations, Uploads, Liked, My Elements, Project Generations. Error: "Only images can be edited here. Pick an image or upload one." |
| Grid "My projects" | cards: thumbnail, name (default "Untitled project"), relative time; states "Processing…", "Couldn't be processed"; menu Open / Delete project |
| Empty | "Your edit projects will appear here" — "Upload an image to separate it into editable layers — every project you start is saved here." |
| Errors | "We couldn't load your projects" · "Try loading projects again" |
| Delete | "Delete this project?" — "This project and all of its layers will be permanently deleted. This cannot be undone. The image it was opened on stays in your gallery." |
| Mobile | "Image editing is desktop only" — "Layer editing needs a bigger canvas than a phone can give it — open this page on desktop." |

Deep link used everywhere else (Assets "Edit", Marketing Studio posters): `/layers?model=nano_banana_pro_inpaint&media=image-job--<jobId>` or `media=image--<uploadId>`. While it opens: "Preparing your project".

### 1.3 Editor layout _(spatial positions inferred)_
* **Tool sidebar (left).** Registered tools; picking one **replaces** the sidebar with that tool's form (back arrow returns). Badges "New" on Layer Decomposition, Edit text, Expand & Crop.
* **Canvas (centre).** Composited layers; select to move, **Resize layer**, **Rotate layer**; drawing tools for masks: Brush, Brush size, Brush colour, Eraser, Eraser size, Free draw, Custom color. Tools act on the selected layer — "Deselect the layer to use this tool on the whole image"; "Unavailable while editing a mask".
* **Layers panel (right).** Header "Layers"; rows in z-order with thumbnail + name; drag to reorder ("Could not reorder the layers."); row actions below.
* **Top bar.** Project name, **Edit history** (versions; "Couldn't delete/download this version"), **Compare** (before/after), **Download** menu, **Copy JSON**, comments with on-canvas marks ("Leave a comment...", Reply, Mark as resolved), Save as Element.

Image tools and the backend each calls:

| tool id | label | backend job |
|---|---|---|
| `layer-separation` | Layer Decomposition (New) | Seedream 5.0 Pro layer separation |
| `upscale` | Upscale | `topaz-image` / `bytedance-image-upscale` |
| `color-grading` | Color Grading | `color-grading-lut` |
| `skin-enhancer` | Enhancer | `skin-enhancer` |
| `relight` | Relight | `relight` |
| `inpaint` | Inpaint | draw-to-edit; the deep link defaults to `nano_banana_pro_inpaint` _(inferred)_ |
| `regional-editing` | Regional Editing | Seedream 5.0 Pro |
| `remove-background` | Remove background | `image-background-remover` |
| `angles` | Angles | `angles` |
| `edit-text` | Edit text (New) | `image-text-detection` → `seedream-v5-pro-text-edit` |
| `expand-crop` | Expand & Crop (New) | `expand-crop` |

The same shell hosts the video tools (Edit video, Reframe, Upscale, Remove Background, Change scene, Relight, Edit Color Palette).

### 1.4 Layer Decomposition
**Settings panel** ("Settings"):

| control | type | options | default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resolution | segmented | 1K · 1.5K · 2K | not exposed |
| Mode | segmented | Standard · Fast (`optimizePromptMode`) | not exposed |
| Layers | slider | 3–16, step 1 | **8** |
| Button | | **Separate layers** (shows cost) | |

**Cost:** `credits = perLayer[resolution] × layers`, `perLayer = {1K: 1.5, 1.5K: 1.5, 2K: 3}` → 8 layers at 1K = 12 credits, at 2K = 24.

**States** (title — body): resolving "Opening layer decomposition — Preparing this image for layers." · stalled "This is taking longer than expected — We could not prepare this image for layers. Try again, and if it keeps happening, reload the page." · failed "Could not open layer decomposition" · unavailable "This image cannot be decomposed — Layer decomposition needs a generated or uploaded image. This asset does not have one." · no-version "Select a finished image — The version open right now is still generating or did not finish, so there is nothing to decompose. Pick a completed image in the history." · setting-up "Setting up layer decomposition — One moment." · submitting "Starting layer decomposition — Preparing your image for processing." · processing "Separating image layers — Your editable layers are being prepared." · failed run "Layer decomposition failed — Try again, or return to the settings." (Back to settings) · ready "Layers are ready — Opening the layer editor." · done "Decomposed — This image is split into # layers. Edit them on the canvas or in the Layers panel."

**Rules.** "An image can only be decomposed once." Submit error "Could not start the split". **Separate layer** splits any one layer again (`nested_separation`) with an optional prompt (what to pull out), same resolution/mode/count controls; toasts "{layerName} split into {added} layers" / "Could not split {layerName}"; while running "Separating {name}, in queue / in progress", "This layer is being split", and delete is blocked ("Can't delete while this layer is being split").

### 1.5 Layers panel and per-layer AI
* **Add layer** → Choose asset (library) · upload ("Uploaded layer") · **Generate layer**. "Failed to add layer".
* Row actions: Show layer / Hide layer · Rename layer · Duplicate · Download · Delete · Add mask / Edit mask / Delete mask · Separate layer · Change layer.
* Per-layer generation: field **"Layer edit prompt"**, **Add reference**, **Generate layer** / **Regenerate layer**; status In queue / In progress / "View generation status" / "Layer generation failed" / "A generation is already running on this layer"; revisions "Show previous versions", "Show next versions", "Restore layer revision", "Reset layer". Tour copy: "Select a layer in the Layers panel, then move it, resize it, or describe your change in its prompt".

### 1.6 Edit text (find & replace)
1. Intro card **How it works** (looping video) — "Edit text finds the text on your image and lists it here. Change any line, then generate a new image with your wording in the original design."
2. **Detect text** (0.5 credits, `image-text-detection`) → blocks `{id, text, bbox {x, y, w, h} in 0–1, confidence}`.
3. Panel **Layers**: one numbered row per block (text input, aria "Text region {n}", placeholder "Remove this text"); hovering a row highlights its box on the canvas. Empty a row to delete that text.
4. Footer: icon **Detect text again** (tooltip "Detect again 0.5 credits") + **Generate** with cost (Seedream 5.0 Pro, one 2K image; ≈2.5 credits _(inferred from the bundle's Seedream 5 Pro table 1K 1.25 / 1.5K 1.25 / 2K 2.5)_).
5. Generate → `seedream-v5-pro-text-edit`, prompt **"Preserve the original design and change only the requested text."**, `textReplacements [{old_text, new_text}]` (max 500), resolution 2k, aspect ratio of the image. Job title: `“old” → “new”` (24-char truncation) / "{n} text changes" / `Remove “old”`.

Empty/stale/errors: "No text was found on this image." · "Restored from your last detection — the image may have changed since. Re-detect if the regions look off." · "Could not read the text on this image." · "Failed to apply the text changes".

### 1.7 Remove background, Regional Editing, Expand & Crop
* **Remove background:** How it works — "Remove background finds the main subject of your image and cuts everything else away, giving you the subject on a transparent background." One button; result becomes a layer edit.
* **Regional Editing:** "Select an area to edit — Draw a rectangle over the image, then describe your changes in the prompt below it." Model picker (Seedream 5.0 Pro) → "Editing region…" → result as two layers **Original** and **New** (show/hide/select each), mask enable/disable + **Mask feather** → **Merge layers** ("Merging…", "Layers merged") · "Edit another region" · Save.
* **Expand & Crop:** "Drag the edges or corners. Crop keeps pixels on layers. Expand adds empty canvas, or turn on Fill with AI to generate it." Toggle **Fill with AI**, Apply / Generate; "The frame no longer overlaps the image. Move it back over the picture."

### 1.8 Downloads (exact)
Menu: **Cropped layers .zip** · **Positioned Layers .zip** · ─ · **Image .png**, plus **Copy JSON** (disabled tooltip "Add a layer to copy as JSON.").

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `cropped-layers.zip` | each image layer rendered alone, cropped to its own rotation-aware bounding box, + `composite.png` |
| `positioned-layers.zip` | each image layer rendered alone on a transparent canvas the size of the whole document (so they restack in place), + `composite.png` |
| names | `layer-z{layerIndex}-{slug}.png`, slug = lower-case name, runs of non-`[a-z0-9]` → `-`, trimmed, ≤48 chars (fallback `layer-{index}`); sorted by z |

Errors: "No layers to download", "Wait for all layers to finish, then try again."

### 1.9 Marketing Studio posters
Poster/layout results open here through the deep link. Copy: "Posters and layouts open like design files. Each headline, date, and image is its own layer — rewrite it, rename it, swap it — then hit Recreate and the style follows." Ads tour: "Break down your image into editable elements — Text, logo, and background become separate layers, so you can edit each one on its own without redoing the whole design." → "You can edit any layer with AI".

### 1.10 Routes for Fuobe
| step | cloud (paid) | open (ComfyUI) |

## 4. Moodboards (Soul 2.0)

"Presets evolved": Curated (built in) and Personal (your own). Soul 2.0 only. Entry: Soul 2.0 generation bar → Moodboard icon → panel with tabs **Curated** / **My Moodboards**, "Search presets...", **Create moodboard**; also `/moodboard` ("AI Moodboard Creator — Define Your Style"). The empty Soul 2.0 composer shows two cards under "Make Soul 2.0 Preset": "Make your own character" and "Create your moodboard".

**Build flow**
1. "CREATE YOUR MOODBOARD — Turn your references into a focused moodboard that defines style, tone, consistent details, and creative direction."
2. Upload: Upload from device / Upload from assets ("Use images you've already created"), "PNG, JPG or Paste from clipboard", Add image, Upload more. Guidance: **Recommended** "20+ photos, one cohesive style, no faces." · **Avoid** "Faces, mixed styles, blurry or low-quality images." (the catalog also has Bad / Good / Perfect labels, likely a reference-quality meter _(inferred)_).
3. Name: "Moodboard name" (server suggests one from the images).
4. **Create moodboard** → trained custom reference (`POST /custom-references/soul-v2-preset {name, input_images}`) → statuses In Queue → In progress → Preparing cover → Complete (or Failed). Using it early: "This moodboard is still training. Try again once it is ready."

| limit | value |
|---|---|
| images | **min 5, max 80** ("Upload at least 5 photos to continue." / "Maximum images per moodboard is 80") |
| image size | ≥256×256 px |
| name | required, ≤100 chars |
| duplicates / NSFW | "This image is already added" · "Remove NSFW images to continue" |
| blog guidance | ~10 high-res images is enough, 20–30 better, up to 80 |

Manage: share link ("Shared by {author}", recipients get "Moodboard added"; "This moodboard link is no longer available"), delete ("Delete moodboard {name}? This cannot be undone." — Yes, delete forever / No, keep them), Reuse. Use: works like a preset (`style_id`) and combines with Soul ID and Soul HEX.

**Routes for Fuobe.** Cloud: Higgsfield Soul 2.0 `style_id` (curated ids above work as-is; personal moodboards need Higgsfield's training endpoint, which is not in the public API, so: fall back to multi-reference style prompting on Nano Banana Pro / Seedream 5, or **fal LoRA training** on Z-Image / FLUX). Open: **AI-Toolkit style LoRA** on Z-Image Turbo from the 5–80 images (training pipeline exists for characters; reuse it with a "style" preset and no face crop), or zero-shot style reference (USO / FLUX Redux are non-commercial FLUX.1-dev derivatives; Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 with the board images as refs is Apache). Moodboard = a Fuobe **style element** with images + optional trained LoRA.

## 5. Soul HEX / Color Transfer

"Soul Hex extracts colors from any image and turns them into your signature style." Available on Soul 2.0 and Soul Cinema. A saved palette is a **color signature**; the library (`/color-presets`) is shared with Cinema Studio 4.0's colour palettes.

**Entry.** Generation-bar chip (tooltip "Color signature"; shows the selected signature's 16 px thumbnail + name, × to clear) opens the **Higgsfield Hex** panel (popover on desktop, drawer on mobile).

**Panel.** Banner "Control Your Colors with Soul Hex — Upload a reference image and let Soul HEX bring its colors in your own style" + **Upload & Create** (collapses on scroll to "Upload a reference image to create your color signature."). Empty state "Ready to Create Your Hex? — Saved hex cards will appear here. No hex yet — upload an image to begin." Grid of 16:9 cards: thumbnail with a 5 px colour strip along the bottom (pure stripes if no thumbnail), name, selected = brand ring + check, extracting = spinner with "Extracting colors from your images. You can use this palette once it's ready."; "…" Palette options → Delete (user palettes).

**Create options** ("Upload photo or create manually to continue"): **Upload from device** (JPEG/PNG/WebP, multiple, **≤20 images**, 1 is enough) or **Pick colors manually**.
* From images: review uploads (leaving: "Are you sure? Your uploaded photos will be lost." Yes, discard / No, keep them) → name ("Looking for name...", "Enter hex name") → Save → extraction runs server-side.
* Manual editor ("Create manually to continue"): **Current palette** (Clear all; **+ Add color** appends `#FFFFFF`; 40 px circles, hover × "Remove color"); click a swatch → picker popover: saturation/hue field, **Hex color code** input (upper-cased), **Pick a color from the screen** (EyeDropper API, disabled where unsupported), toggle **Use as background** (that swatch shows "BG"). **Random palettes** panel: 4 rows of random colours (each 2–12 random `#RRGGBB`, shown trimmed to 6), refresh "Generate random palettes", click a row to load it. **Save palette** → `POST /color-presets/manual {hex_colors, background_color}`.
* Defaults: colours `#FFFFFF`, `#D1FE17`, `#1C1E20`, background `#53C546`. Limits: 1–12 colours (10 on Recraft V4.1), each `/^#[0-9a-f]{6}$/i`.

**Color Transfer** (separate tool, "New Color Transfer", "Clear color transfer"): apply a finished grade to existing outputs so a series matches.

**Built-in palettes (50, exact hex).** Each has 12 colours; in every palette the 12th colour is also its `background_color` (the HEX card strip shows the background first, then the other 11, de-duplicated); `slug` is the Cinema Studio 4.0 API `color_palette` value (all 50 match Fuobe's generated enum, including the API's own spelling `crimson-vigi`).

The palettes named in the Help Center and blog (Film colors, Lime Jam, Candy pink, Nostalgic blue, Soft palette, Black gloss) are no longer returned by the API or present in the UI catalog; their hex values could not be obtained. Fuobe already ships them as prompt-only grades in `src/lib/catalog/motions.ts`.

**Routes for Fuobe.** Extraction: k-means in the browser (no model). Apply: cloud Soul 2.0/Soul Cinema have no public palette field, so inject the hex list into the prompt (FLUX.2, Nano Banana, Seedream and GPT Image follow hex codes) and optionally run **palette transfer** after; open: FLUX.2 hex prompting + the existing `palette-transfer-image` / `palette-transfer-video` ComfyUI graphs (✅ on CPU). Cinema Studio 4.0 cloud: pass the palette's `slug` as `color_palette`.

Categories from `/soul/preset-categories` (a preset can be in several; 41 are categorised, the rest only appear under "All presets"): **New, TikTok Core, Instagram Aesthetics, Camera Presets, Beauty, Mood, Surreal, Graphic Art**. The picker also shows **All** and, behind a feature flag (`access-image-style-category-dump`), **Dump**. The Help Center's older list ("General, TikTok Core, Instagram Aesthetics, Beauty, Mood, Camera Photo, Graphic Art") is out of date. Default preset `General` = `464ea177-8d40-4940-8d9d-b438bab269c7` (the same id the public API uses as `style_id`). Descriptions are Higgsfield's except the 35 marked _inferred_ (Higgsfield publishes none for them; most are the Sep 2025 "dump" batch).

**Soul 2.0** — the curated moodboards in §4 (default `General` = `3db34ab5-3439-4317-9e03-08dc30852e69`). Soul Cinema has no presets (two hidden styles "General" / "Soul 1.5 General").

**Composer settings (Soul 2.0).** Aspect 9:16, 3:4, 2:3, 1:1, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 · Quality **1.5k** ("1.5k quality, fastest and cheapest", API value 720p) / **2K** ("2k quality, best visual fidelity", 1080p) · batch 1–4 · Enhance prompt · preset or moodboard · Soul ID · Soul HEX · reference image (disables the prompt). **0.125 credits per image** at either quality.

**What Fuobe has / should add.** Fuobe fetches the Soul style lists live from Higgsfield (`src/server/providers/higgsfield.ts`, `soul-v1` / `soul-v2` sources), so the pickers are empty without a key, and it has no categories. Add the JSON list as a static fallback with categories, previews and descriptions; on the open engine use each preset's description as a prompt template on Z-Image Turbo / FLUX.1 Krea (prompt-only parity).

## 7. Character Sheet ("Build Your AI Avatar", `/character-sheet`)

"Create a consistent AI character for your videos — from reference or define your character's look from scratch."

* **From Reference:** drop zone "Drop images here", 1–5 images ("Upload at least 1 image", "Maximum 5 images") → **Create AI Avatar** → `POST /jobs/v2/character_sheet {params: {medias: [{role: "image", data: {id, type}}]}}` → "Submitting...", "Processing {completed}/{total}", "Creating..." → a character sheet saved as a reusable reference element. Errors "Failed to create character sheet", "Protected or Inappropriate content is not allowed".
* **or build from scratch:** the **Soul Cast** form (Randomize, Reset) → `cinematic_studio_soul_cast` with `create_reference_element: true`, 16:9, 1080p, batch 1.

Public API equivalent already in Fuobe: `higgsfield/ai-influencer` character sheet ($0.05) as the AI Influencer app.

**Routes for Fuobe.** Cloud: Higgsfield `ai-influencer` (exists) or Nano Banana Pro with a "character sheet: front, 3/4, profile, full body on white" prompt from the references. Open: Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 multi-reference with the same sheet prompt, or Z-Image Turbo from a Soul Cast-style structured prompt; result saved as an @element (the "Save as character" path exists).

---

## 8. Soul Location (Cinema Studio)

Cinema Studio's set builder ("Cinema Studio Soul Location"; model card **Cinematic Locations — Rich environments with cinematic lighting**). The Elements panel has **Characters** ("Reuse characters across scenes", Create Character) and **Locations** ("Keep every scene in the same world", Create Location).

Flow: **Create Location / New Location** → "Describe your location" (≤2,500 chars) **or** "Or upload your own location" → Generate location (job `soul_location`, 0.125 credits per image) → "Building location: {name}" → "Built location: {name}" / "Location build failed: {name}" → "Show the same location from another view." → **Save location** / Save As Location ("Saved as Location") → Use location / Change location / Delete location ("This removes {name} from your locations."). Limits: "Max {n} locations", "Max {n} location or prop" per generation; composer placeholder "Describe your scene - use @ to add characters & locations".

**Routes for Fuobe.** Cloud: Soul Cinema / Nano Banana Pro for the establishing shot, Nano Banana Pro or Qwen multi-angle (fal) for other views. Open: Z-Image Turbo / Qwen-Image 2512 for the empty set, **Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 + Multiple-Angles LoRA** (in the research already) for "another view". Save as a `location` element (the element type exists).

## 9. Build recommendation for Fuobe

Order chosen by value per effort. Everything below is a recommendation only (no code was changed in this round of research). File names follow Fuobe's existing conventions.

**0. Shared data (S).** Add a generator `scripts/gen-higgsfield-presets.py` that reads `higgsfield-image-studios.json` and writes `src/lib/catalog/higgsfield-presets.generated.ts`: Soul v1/v2 presets (id, name, category list, description, preview), the 50 palettes (name, slug, 12 colours, background), Fashion Factory templates and Photodump packs. Use it as the **fallback** in `higgsfieldPresets()` when there is no Higgsfield key, and give the style picker category tabs (All · New · TikTok Core · Instagram Aesthetics · Camera Presets · Beauty · Mood · Surreal · Graphic Art for Soul; All · Mood · Styles · Camera for Soul 2.0). The ids are Higgsfield's real `style_id`s, so the same list drives the cloud call and the open-engine prompt template (the description).

**1. Layers studio `/layers` (L–XL, highest value).**
* Data: `layer_projects` (id, source asset, name, created) + `layer_versions` (doc JSON). Doc = `{width, height, nodes: [{id, name, layerIndex, geometry {x, y, width, height, rotation}, assetId, maskAssetId?, hidden}]}`; the composite and every layer stay ordinary assets in the library.
* New operation `layer-decompose` with routes: Replicate `bytedance/seedream-5-pro` (`layer_decomposition: true`, `size`, optional `prompt`), fal `fal-ai/qwen-image-layered` (`num_layers`), and a new ComfyUI workflow `qwen-image-layered` exported from the official template `image_qwen_image_layered` (+ `qwen-image-layered-control` for prompt-guided splits) through `scripts/comfy` and validated like the other 73. Seedream returns each layer with its stacking order, bounding box, name and description (Replicate schema); Qwen-Image-Layered returns full-canvas RGBA layers, so compute each bbox from alpha in the browser. Nested "Separate layer" = run the same op on one layer.
* UI (shadcn): `ResizablePanelGroup` with a left tool rail (`ScrollArea` + buttons; a chosen tool replaces the rail with its form and a back arrow), a centre canvas (HTML canvas with selection handles for move / resize / rotate), and a right Layers panel (sortable list with dnd-kit, eye `Toggle`, `DropdownMenu` row actions: Rename, Duplicate, Download, Delete, Add mask, Separate layer, Generate layer). Top bar: name, history `Sheet`, compare (the existing `compare-slider`), Download `DropdownMenu` (Cropped layers .zip / Positioned Layers .zip / Image .png, built client-side with JSZip and canvas using the exact naming in §1.8), Copy JSON.
* Tools, first pass: Layer Decomposition (Resolution `ToggleGroup` 1K/1.5K/2K, Mode Standard/Fast, `Slider` 3–16 default 8, live cost), Remove background (existing BiRefNet routes), Edit text (OCR → numbered editable rows highlighted on the canvas → edit model with "Preserve the original design and change only the requested text."), Generate layer (existing edit models on the cropped layer, pasted back), Regional edit (rectangle → edit → Original/New layers → merge), Expand & Crop (existing outpaint). Upscale, Relight, Angles, Color grade and Enhancer reuse the existing apps with the layer as input.
* Entry points: "Open in Layers" on viewer/library tiles and `/layers?asset=<id>`; later Marketing/Ads posters open here.

**2. Soul HEX color signatures (S–M).** A `palettes` table (name, 1–12 colours, optional background, source images, built-in flag) seeded with the 50 palettes. Panel as a shadcn `Popover` (desktop) / `Drawer` (mobile) with the exact states in §5: cards with colour strip, Upload & Create (≤20 images, k-means extraction in a Web Worker, no model), manual editor with `react-colorful` (MIT) picker + hex input + EyeDropper + "Use as background", Random palettes (4 rows, 2–12 colours shown as 6), Save. Apply to any image model by appending `Color palette: #… #… (background #…)` to the prompt, plus an optional "lock colours" post step using the existing `palette-transfer-image` graph (open) or Match Colors app (cloud); pass `slug` as `color_palette` on Cinema Studio 4.0. Replace the 16 prompt-only "Color Grade" entries' guesses with real palettes where names match.

**3. Moodboards (M).** A new element type `style` (5–80 images, ≥256 px, name ≤100) with the build flow in §4 (Recommended / Avoid guidance, statuses, share link later). Cloud: curated ids → Soul 2.0 `style_id`; personal → images as style references on Nano Banana Pro / Seedream 5, or fal LoRA training. Open: reuse the AI-Toolkit training path with a style preset (no face crop) to make a Z-Image Turbo LoRA, falling back to Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 multi-reference.

**4. Photodump (M).** `/photodump`: Choose a Pack → pick a character element **or** upload one selfie (Instadump mode) → aspect ratio → Generate (a job per style, run as one batch; the chained-jobs runner exists) → results grid with Download All (zip), Animate, Edit. Packs are Fuobe prompt packs named and sized like Higgsfield's (§2.4), plus Create pack from ≤15 reference photos. Cloud: Soul 2.0 + Soul ID or Nano Banana Pro with the selfie; open: character LoRA on Z-Image Turbo or Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 with the selfie.

**5. Fashion Factory (M).** A five-step wizard (template → character → choose 1 of 4 base shots at 3:4 → upload outfit, Generate outfit, pick → photoset) with the six templates as prompt packs. Cloud: Soul 2.0 / Nano Banana Pro, then Nano Banana Pro edit (person + garment) or fal FASHN try-on, then a Nano Banana Pro batch. Open: Z-Image Turbo + character LoRA, Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 multi-image for the outfit and each shot.

**6. Character Sheet + Soul Cast (S).** Extend the AI Influencer app with the two paths in §7: From Reference (1–5 images) and Build from scratch using the Soul Cast option lists (image-card `ToggleGroup`s, Randomize, Reset) turned into a structured prompt; save the sheet as a character element.

**7. Soul Location (S, with the Cinema Studio workspace).** Location element builder: describe (≤2,500 chars) or upload → generate the empty set → "another view" with Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 + Multiple-Angles LoRA (open) / Nano Banana Pro (cloud) → save as a location element.

**Open questions for a GPU run:** Qwen-Image-Layered quality and VRAM at 1024 px with the fp8 weights (20.5 GB diffusion model + 7B text encoder); how Seedream's per-layer metadata (Replicate: "Each returned layer includes its stacking order, bounding box, name, and description") is shaped in the actual output, which Fuobe should map straight onto `layerIndex`, `geometry` and `name`; OCR quality on stylised poster text.
