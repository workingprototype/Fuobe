# Higgsfield marketing studios, agents and the Assets library

_As of 2026-10-17. Machine-readable twin: [`higgsfield-marketing-agents.json`](higgsfield-marketing-agents.json) (all 1,074 Marketing Studio templates, hooks, settings, presets, skills, node types and payloads). This deepens §2.6 and §2.7 of [`higgsfield-inventory.md`](higgsfield-inventory.md). Cinema Studio, Shorts Studio and Mixed Media are in [`higgsfield-studios.md`](higgsfield-studios.md)._

Covered: **Marketing Studio**, **Ads Studio**, **Ad Multiplier**, **Click to Ad / Link to Video Ad**, **Faceless Studio**, **Higgsfield Explainer**, **Canvas**, **Katana**, **Virality Predictor**, the **Assets library**, and Supercomputer's **Skills**, **Projects** and **Memory**.

**How this was researched.** Logged-in screens were not observed. Instead:

1. **Public CMS endpoints** that answer without a login. They hold the full Marketing Studio catalog and template feed, the UGC hooks and settings, the Faceless, Explainer, Katana and legacy Click-to-Ad preset lists, the Canvas templates, the Supercomputer skills catalog, a Virality Predictor demo analysis and the credit formulas.
2. **Server-rendered state.** TanStack Query state is dehydrated into the SSR HTML of `/marketing-studio`, `/faceless-studio` and `/asset`. A small literal parser read it; no page code was run.
3. **Production JS.** Build `868a8dba`, the same 8,020 chunks as `higgsfield-studios.md`. The chunks give the job payload builders, validators, limits, enums and menu definitions.
4. **i18n catalogs.** Route deltas, plus the full English catalog mapped to chunks by message id. They give the UI copy.
5. **Docs and pages.** Help Center, Changelog, blog posts, landing and skill pages. A web search for third-party coverage turned up little beyond Higgsfield's own pages.

Statements reasoned from code or copy, rather than seen, are marked *(inferred)*. Every URL is in [Sources](#sources) and in the JSON `sources` block.

**The most useful findings for the build:**
- **Marketing Studio's whole catalog is public.**
  - It has 7 categories and 17 formats, and each format lists its generation job type, fixed params and *capabilities* (avatar/product required, durations, aspect ratios, batch, brand kit).
  - The feed has **1,074 templates**: 1,051 visible and 23 hidden. That is fewer than the "1,500+" in the blog.
  - Every template has a name, type, format, aspect ratio or duration, and cover. Only the legacy video modes carry a written description.
- **UGC hooks and settings are prompts.** There are 9 hooks ("Product Hit", "Camera Bump"…) and 14 settings ("Bedroom", "Volcano Rim"…), each a one-paragraph scene prompt. The text is listed below, so Fuobe can reproduce the mechanic exactly.
- **The job builders are readable.** Every format's request shape, limits and validation message is known, including the `<<<product:id>>>` and `<<<avatar:id>>>` prompt tokens. Prompts are capped at **5,000** characters. Durations are **4–30 s** for the tools, **15–30 s** for UGC and **5–15 s** for motion. Images are capped at **32 MB**.
- **Ads Studio has 7 steps.** Website → brand research (14 progress labels) → review the brand kit (14 fields) → products → **up to 20 ads per product** (4 credits each) → grid → chat with *Mention a product*. Each ad is a single image with a headline, copy and CTA in 1:1, 4:5 and 9:16.
- **Ad Multiplier's form is small.** It takes a reference video (4–30 s), up to 20 @-mentioned images, and three mutually-exclusive parts: Prompt, or Hook and/or CTA. Resolution is 480p, 720p or 1080p (default 1080p). It runs on **Seedance 2.5 edit** and costs 3 / 7 / 16 credits per second.
- **Faceless Studio** has 12 styles (not 8), 4 genres and 1–5 min episodes. *Fully animated* costs **41 credits per 10 s**; *Frame by Frame* costs **16 credits per 10 s**. It runs on **Gemini Omni Flash** video plus narration and subtitles. **Explainer** has 22 styles, runs Auto or 15–600 s, takes ≤3 sources and ≤14 media, and outputs 16:9 or 9:16.
- **Canvas** has a fixed node menu: Prompt, Image / Video / Voice Generator, LLM Assistant, Page, Video Concatenator, Change Voice, Translate, Upload, Assets, Text, Sticky Note and Table. It offers Run node, Run all and Run pipeline, and there are 5 public templates. Fuobe's chained jobs already provide the execution model.
- **Virality Predictor** returns a full output JSON: score, hook score, hold rate, a per-second curve, a peak second and five cortical networks defined on the **fsaverage** mesh. That matches Meta's open **TRIBE v2** brain-encoding model (CC BY-NC 4.0), which gives Fuobe a real open-source route instead of today's "not reproducible" app.

## 1. Marketing Studio

### 1.1 Where it lives, what runs it

| | |
|---|---|
| Routes | `/marketing-studio` (`?tool=url-to-ad`, `?tool=ad-reference`, `?tool=app-video`, `?category=…`), `/marketing-studio/preset/{slug}-{id}`, `/marketing-studio/p/{id}`, `/marketing-studio/generations`, `/favorites`, `/projects`; public `/marketing-studio-community`; landing `/marketing-studio-intro`. `/apps/link-to-video-ad` and `/app/link-to-video-ad` redirect to `?tool=url-to-ad` |
| Data | `GET cms.higgsfield.ai/marketing-studio-v2/catalog?lang=en&show_hidden=…`; `GET …/categories/{slug}/presets?size=&cursor=&show_hidden=` (the slug is ignored server-side; the client filters); `GET …/motion-presets?size=100`; hooks/settings `GET fnf…/marketing-studio/setup/{hooks,settings}`; brand kits, products, avatars, ad references and cost quote are authenticated `fnf` endpoints (§1.7–1.10) |
| Job set types | `marketing_studio_2_image` (types `product_shots`, `product_shots_people`, `ads`, `poster`, `marketplace`) and `marketing_studio_v2_video` (types `ugc`, `video_mode`, `2d_motion`, `hypermotion`, `mixed_media`, `saas_motion`, `product_link`, `ad_reference`, `app_video`) |
| Models | Images: "MS Image" (public API `/marketing-studio/image` 2.0 Alpha, `/image/flare` = GPT Image 2.5 Flare, `/image/sunburst`; already in Fuobe as `marketing-studio-image`). Product motion: "Higgsfield Motion" (blog). UGC: Seedance 2 *(inferred from the UGC skill page)* |
| History | Before Aug 18, 2026 it was prompt-first with 9 formats (the legacy `video_mode` styles below). Since then it is template-first |

### 1.2 Layout

The regions are read from SSR markup (`data-ms2-*` attributes) and the route strings; their placement is *(inferred)*.

| Region | Content |
|---|---|
| Left sidebar | **Marketing Studio** title · Home · My generations · My favorites · **Tools**: Ad Reference, Product Link (App video when enabled) · **Projects** + *New project* (Find project.., Sort projects). Project side views: assets, avatars, products, elements |
| Hero | Category cards floating around the headline **"Turn any product / into ready to post content"**: UGC, Product shot, Motion, Ads, Posters, Marketplace, TikTok. Button **Browse templates** |
| Template grid | **Explore templates**: category tabs *All · Product shot · Motion · UGC · TikTok · Ads · Posters · Marketplace* and a media filter *All · Images · Videos*. Row-packed masonry: compact under 1,360 px container width, wide above. Each card shows a type chip and the name. Chips: *Product shot*, *Product motion* (2D, hypermotion, mixed media, SaaS, legacy motion), *UGC video*, *TikTok*, *Ads*, *Poster*, *Marketplace*. Video covers play on hover. Pages hold 12 cards the first time, then more |
| Composer | Docked at the bottom (`data-ms2-composer`, §1.5). Opening a template fills it ("Recreate template") |
| Empty / errors | "Loading Marketing Studio", "Could not load Marketing Studio.", "No presets are available yet.", "Motion presets could not be loaded.", "This preset is no longer available." |

### 1.3 Catalog: categories → formats → styles

Capabilities come from each format's `default_style.metadata.capabilities`. The UI shows only the controls these allow.

| Category | Format (availability) | Job type · fixed params | Avatar / product | Durations | Aspect ratios | Batch | Brand kit | Styles |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| UGC | Talking head | v2_video · `ugc`, `delivery_specs.mode=talking` | optional / optional | 15–30 s, def 20 | auto, 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:4, 9:16 | ≤4 | – | Shopping, At home, Delivery, Review, Try-on, Unboxing, Tutorial, Before/after (+ hidden General, Product Review, TV Spot, Wild Card) |
| UGC | Faceless (coming soon) | `ugc`, mode `faceless` | | | | | | – |

| UGC | UGC (legacy modes) | `video_mode` | optional / optional | 4–15 s, def 12 | as above | ≤4 | – | 12 modes (§1.4) · resolutions 480p / 720p / 1080p |
| Product shot | With model | 2_image · `product_shots_people` | one of product or avatar | – | 1:1, 3:2, 2:3, 4:3, 3:4, 9:16, 16:9 | – | – | Closeup, Faceless, Full body, Editorial, UGC |
| Product shot | Standalone | `product_shots` | none / **required** | – | 1:1, 3:2, 2:3, 4:3, 3:4, 4:5, 5:4, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9 | fans out | ✓ | Studio white, Color pop, Natural, Usage |
| Motion | 2D product motion | v2_video · `2d_motion` | none / required | 5–15, def 5 | video set | ≤4 | – | General |
| Motion | Hypermotion | `hypermotion` | none / required | 5–15, def 15 | video set | ≤4 | – | General, Typography, Dark Minimalism, Color pop |
| Motion | Mixed media | `mixed_media` | none / required | 5–15, def 15 | video set | ≤4 | – | General |
| Motion | SaaS | `saas_motion` | none / optional; needs one of prompt, product, **brand_url** | 5–15, def 5 | video set (aspect **required**) | ≤4 | – | General |
| Motion | Motion (legacy) | `video_mode` | optional | 4–15, def 12 | video set | ≤4 | – | Product Showcase ("Highlight your product") |
| Ads | General | 2_image · `ads` | optional / **required** | – | 1:1, 3:2, 2:3, 4:3, 3:4, 9:16, 16:9 | – | ✓ | Social proof, Comparison, Problem → Solution |
| Posters | General | 2_image · `poster` | none / optional; needs prompt or product | – | template-defined | – | ✓ | 174 styles (same ids as the 174 poster templates) |
| Marketplace | General | 2_image · `marketplace` | optional / **required** | – | 1:1 … 16:9 | – | ✓ | Dark, 3D surreal, Pastel, Clean Studio (+ hidden Color pop) |
| TikTok | TikTok (legacy) | `video_mode` | optional / optional | 4–15, def 12 | video set | ≤4 | – | 8 modes (§1.4) |

The help article and the task brief also name **Ref → Video**. In the app that is the **Ad Reference** tool (§1.6), not a template category.

### 1.4 Template library (1,074 records)

The first 12 sit in UGC, the next 8 in TikTok, and Product Showcase in Motion. The landing page describes the older names in more detail. *TV Spot*: "Broadcast-ready product ads with cinematic camera work, real-world locations, and story arcs". *UGC*: "Face-to-camera product reviews … shot in iPhone style". *Tutorial*: "Step-by-step how-to videos where the person talks and demonstrates at the same time". *Product Review*: "Close-up hands-on footage with natural voiceover". *Unboxing*: "Package arrives, tape rips, product revealed, genuine reaction". *Hyper Motion*: "Pure CGI product commercial … no people, no voiceover". *Pro Virtual Try On*: "Your product in motion on city streets". *Wild Card*: "Describe a scenario and let AI direct the whole thing".

All template names follow, by category. Ids, aspect ratios, durations, motion modes and covers are in the JSON. Most templates have no written description, so the JSON `description` is derived from metadata and labelled as such.

### 1.5 Composer

| Control | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Generation mode | **Image mode ⇄ Video mode** |
| Product slot | "Add your product". Actions: **Paste a link · Upload a photo · Choose from assets**. States: Add / Change / Remove Product. The badge says *Required* or *Optional with an edit*. Copy: "Choose a product image or add a link." |
| Avatar slot | Choose avatar → Selected avatar · Replace · Remove · "Preparing avatar…". Error: "We couldn't attach this avatar. Try again." |
| Reference | A photo reference. For `ugc` it is sent as `location_photo`; in Ad Reference it is a video |
| Website or social link | Placeholder `www.example.com`. Errors: "Add a website or social link.", "Enter a valid website URL" |
| Hook / Setting | Only when the format has `hook_and_setting`. Controls: *Replace hook · No hook · See all hooks* and *Replace setting · No setting · See all settings*. Lists in the next table. Users can create their own (`POST /marketing-studio/setup`; "Hook is required for preview generation"). Templates with a built-in hook show "This template can't swap its hook or take a setting yet. Keep its own hook and no setting." |
| Prompt | Placeholders: "Describe your edit" / "What should look different?" / "What do you want to change?" / "Describe the poster you want to create." / "Describe the scene you imagine...". Max 5,000 characters. The selected product and avatar are prepended as `<<<product:{id}>>> <<<avatar:{id}>>>` |
| Settings | Resolution, Duration, Aspect ratio and Batch, taken from capabilities (§1.3). "Aspect ratio: {x}" chip |
| Brand kit | A chip when `brand_kit: true` (product shot standalone, ads, posters, marketplace). Adds `brand_kit_id` |
| Generate | **Recreate template** / **Recreate** / "Recreating…". The cost comes live from `POST /marketing-studio/v2/costs/quote` (the quote uses the first 350 prompt characters). Up to 6 image references go in `medias[]` |

**UGC hooks** (`GET /marketing-studio/setup/hooks`):

| Hook | Type | Prompt |
|---|---|---|
| Product Hit | stunt | Object flies into frame, hits subject. Brief reaction → pivot to product. |
| Spicy | subtle | The shot starts with an extreme close-up of a collarbone, slowly tilts up to reveal a flawless makeup look, then pulls back into selfie framing before a silent pause leads into the product pitch. |
| Interview | subtle | Interviewer asks a second stranger a question based entirely on the first stranger's random answer; confusion builds until the second person naturally notices the product (Erewhon-style aspirational item) and pivots into a casual review. |
| Random Object Mic | stunt | During a casual vlog, a random absurd object falls into the person's hand from above, and they immediately use it as a microphone to continue a completely serious product review. |
| Product Crash | subtle | The product itself falls from above and destroyed, creating chaos; harsh sharpness leads to a perfectly clean and restored scene where a person calmly begins reviewing the product. |
| Blizzard | stunt | A cozy indoor scene is suddenly hit by a violent, impossible blizzard; chaos fills the room but the product remains intact and functioning, and once the storm stops, the product is still working. |
| Camera Bump | subtle | The camera operator accidentally bumps into a person, hitting their forehead; they react briefly, recover, and naturally reveal the dress (or product on it) while transitioning into a casual explanation. |
| Product Dodge | stunt | Suddenly, a product flies into a person's face; he quickly bends down to avoid a collision, and in the next frame he stands up straight and already holds the product in his hands and begins to review as if nothing had happened. |
| Epic Fail | subtle | A person performs an unsuccessful backflip, lands unsuccessfully, falls, and immediately, without pause, takes out the product and begins an unflappable review. |

**UGC settings** (`GET /marketing-studio/setup/settings`):

| Setting | Type | Prompt |
|---|---|---|
| Bedroom | realistic | On bed or propped against pillows, soft window light. Unmade bed, cozy textures. Relaxed morning or evening wind-down vibe — honest, low-effort feel. |
| Nature | realistic | Outdoors — trail, park, beach, or garden depending on product. Natural light, greenery or open sky. Active or peaceful mood — setting adapts to product. |
| Gym | realistic | Gym floor, locker room, or post-workout bench. Bright overhead lighting, equipment in background. Sweaty or freshly finished energy — product tied to performance or recovery. |
| Bathroom | realistic | Mirror selfie or front camera in bathroom. Ring light or vanity lighting, tiles visible. Intimate getting-ready energy — product shown mid-routine, close-up friendly. |
| Kitchen | realistic | Standing at counter or leaning on island, natural daylight. Clean surface, mug or fruit in background. Casual mid-day energy — product fits daily routine. |
| In Car | realistic | Selfie from passenger or driver seat, parked or cruising. Window light on face. Casual tone — talking to camera between errands. |
| Street | realistic | Walking on sidewalk or standing on urban street, handheld selfie. City backdrop — storefronts, traffic, pedestrians. Energetic pace, talking while moving. Spontaneous discovery feel. |
| Office | realistic | Desk setup, laptop open, coffee nearby. Clean modern space, soft overhead or monitor glow. Hushed mid-workday tone — quick product mention squeezed between tasks. |
| Airplane Wing | unrealistic | Person sits on airplane wing mid-flight at altitude. Casual product review — powerful wind, clouds, engine roar. |
| Roofing | unrealistic | Person on the edge of a skyscraper rooftop, city skyline stretched out behind … casual product review with the entire city below, character completely unbothered by the height — selfie camera, golden hour or dusk. |
| Volcano Rim | unrealistic | Person sits on active volcano rim, lava below. Casual product review — lava bubbles, smoke drifts through, zero reaction. |
| Tiny Reviewer | unrealistic | Person shrunk to 15cm next to a product their full height. Normal selfie review at impossible scale — leans on it. |
| Car Roof | unrealistic | Person on roof of moving car, desert highway, golden hour. Product review while swaying with the road. Semi truck passes — no flinch. |
| Train Surf | unrealistic | Person hangs outside a moving train, filming selfie. Reviews product — wind pressing on them is the live demo. |

### 1.7 Brand Kit

- **Entry.** The composer *Brand kit* chip opens **"ADD YOUR BRAND KIT — One link is all we need to keep every campaign perfectly on-brand."** with three choices: paste website → *Submit website*, *or* **Create manually**.
- **Progress.** "Analyzing your business..." → "Generating your brand kit..." → "We're researching and analyzing your business. It usually takes 1-2 minutes". A *Cancel generation* button is shown throughout.
- **Done.** **"Your Brand Kit is ready — Review your brand details - we'll use them to keep your content consistent across all generations. Feel free to edit this at any time."**
- **Empty state.** "No brand kit added yet — Paste a link or create one manually to get started".
- **Manual create.** Prompt: "Describe your business — what you sell, who it's for, what makes it yours". There are five example chips: Food & Beverage "Acme Coffee — we roast specialty beans…", Home & Lifestyle "Loom & Linen…", Fashion "Maison Vale…", Beauty & Skincare "Nora & Co.…" and Digital Services "Hatchwork…". An optional *Your Product* upload says "We'll generate a complete identity around it — palette, typography, mood, everything". Validation: "Add a description or upload images".

| Field (`data.*`) | UI |
|---|---|
| `brand_name` | Name / Company name, "Enter brand name" |

Record: `{id, status, latest_progress {step, step_label, step_index, total_steps, progress 0–1, status, error, at}, job_set_id, created_at, updated_at}`. API: `GET/POST /marketing-studio/brand-kits` (limit, offset) and `GET/PUT/DELETE /marketing-studio/brand-kits/{id}`.

- "Paste the product's link — a description alone is not enough."

Duplicates: "«{0}» is already among this brand's products." → *Create anyway*. Products are stored in a library that is reused across templates, Ads Studio and the agents.

### 1.9 Avatars

- **Library.** Presets plus your own, with tabs, a gender filter, search and pins. The landing says "Pick from 40+ avatars" in one place and "100+" in the FAQ. The blog says With Model draws on "20 avatar templates".
- **Create.**
  - **Generate** from a text prompt ("Describe who you want to generate - age, style, vibe"; Soul 2.0).
  - **Upload** ("Turn any photo into an avatar", `POST /marketing-studio/avatars/extract`).
  - **Use AI influencer as avatar.**

- **Video.** `marketing_studio_video` costs **3.5 / 5 / 13 credits per second** at 480p / 720p / 1080p (list price 4 / 6 / 13). The blog's examples: 8 s at 720p = 47.62 credits ($2.38); 15 s at 720p = 89.2 credits.
- **Images.** Product shot at 2K = **1.5 credits**; Poster at 2K = **7.5 credits** ($0.05 per credit).
- **Clip length.** Help and blog say 15 s per generation. The builder accepts up to 30 s for UGC and the tools.
- **Editing.** Only Posters can be edited afterwards (in Layers); every other category is regenerated.
- **Agents.** Help says template Marketing Studio is "not available through Supercomputer, MCP … yet". The **Marketing Studio Cards** skill does expose "321 layouts" of posters, Meta ads and listing cards to agents.

| 5 | **How many ads to create?** | A per-product stepper (− n +) up to **20 ads per product**. Summary: "Create # ads for {product pills} and the brand". **4 credits per ad** (blog: 10 ads = 40 credits ≈ $2, 20 = 80 ≈ $4); the total is shown before the run |
| 6 | **Grid** | "Generating # ads — they land in the grid as they render." Toolbar: Filter (All products / one product) · View **Split by products** · Layout / Card size / Fill-Fit · **Download all**.

- **Brand shelf.** "Every brand gets its own research, products and ads". Delete copy: "“{name}” leaves the shelf with its kit and its products. Ads already made with it stay."

## 3. Ad Multiplier

Launched as a Claude skill on Aug 25, 2026; the web UI followed on Oct 6, 2026.

| | |
|---|---|
| Route | `/ads-studio/ad-multiplier` (recreate: `?{param}={jobSetId}`) |
| Job | `ad_multiplier_v2` (plus `ad_multiplier`, `ad_multiplier_replace`); model **Seedance 2.5 edit** (skill page: "Editing variations with Seedance 2.5") |
| Layout | Form on the left, *My generations* on the right. Empty state **"One ad, many versions"** with four cards: Start with an ad you like · Find a better hook or CTA · Say it your way · Get a batch at once. Footer: "Swap the characters, outfits, locations, and products. Motion, timing, and audio stay untouched." *(inferred placement)* |
| Reference video | One video, **4–30 s** ("Add a reference video to recreate · Video duration: 4-30 seconds"), trimmable |
| Images | Up to **20** ("Add up to 20 images"). Mention them as `@image_1`… in the text; they are sent as `<<<image_1>>>`. Errors: "This image is already added", "This image was made for that run and can't be added" |
| Parts | **Prompt** (default on): "Recreates the reference video with your characters, products, and any changes you describe." Placeholder "Describe your new version — e.g. 'the same ad for the German market with a woman in her 30s' or 'keep the original voice'. Mention attached images using @...". Default text "Recreate this ad." · **Change hook**: "Keeps the rest of the video as is and adds or replaces the opening hook. Disables the prompt." ("Write your hook — e.g. 'What if your AI videos paid your rent?'") · **Change CTA**: "Keeps the rest … call to action at the end. Disables the prompt." ("Write your call to action — e.g. 'Start creating for free today'") |
| Rules | Prompt and Hook/CTA are mutually exclusive; Hook and CTA can be on together. In sections mode the text is sent as `HOOK: …\n\nCTA: …`. Max **4,000** characters ("Keep the words under 4000 characters") |
| Quality | **480p / 720p / 1080p**, default 1080p. The cost table also lists 4K, which the UI does not offer |
| Quote | `{job_set_type: ad_multiplier_v2, params:{duration, resolution, mode: full or sections, section: hook, cta or both}}`. Failure copy: "Failed to calculate the price. Please try again." |
| Cost | **3 / 7 / 16 credits per second** at 480p / 720p / 1080p, with or without video (4K 26–27) |
| What changes | Product, cast, location, script, hook or CTA. Original audio is kept on every non-translated variant. Captions can be removed or regenerated in another language with a synthetic voiceover (skill). Hooks and CTAs can be retried without re-uploading |

---

## 4. Click to Ad / Link to Video Ad

**Now.** Click to Ad is the Marketing Studio **Product Link** tool (§1.6). `/apps/link-to-video-ad` and `/apps/click-to-ad` lead there.

**Before**, the legacy app *(still in the bundle)* worked like this:
1. Landing: "TURN ANY PRODUCT INTO A video AD — Paste a product URL and we'll create a scroll-stopping video ad with AI avatars and voiceover in minutes."
2. **Product page URL**, or *Build from scratch*.
3. **BUILDING YOUR PRODUCT KIT** (1–2 min): Connecting to website → Extracting product images → Finding brand colors → Locating logo → Processing details → Finalizing product kit. A mini-game runs while you wait: "Press Space to start".
4. **YOUR PRODUCT KIT** ("Review the details we extracted. You can edit anything before generating your video."):
   - Product images: "These 3 images will be used in your video"; extra *Additional images found* can be dragged up to swap; at most 5.
   - Logo & Brand colors.
   - Product name (required) and Description (required).
5. **CHOOSE YOUR AD STYLE**: presets, **Script mode** (*Auto-generate* / *Custom script*: "Add specific instructions for your ad script (e.g., highlight eco-friendly materials, include limited-time offer, emphasize free shipping)"), **Video quality** (Standard / High / Premium, with the credit cost per option).
6. **CREATING YOUR VIDEO** (2–5 min, up to 10 for high quality) → **YOUR VIDEO IS READY**. Actions: Create another, Edit Product Kit, Go to Library.

The FAQ said 9:16 output, up to 12 s, "over 25 presets" with hard-coded captions or a "no caption" style. The live preset list (`cms…/link-to-ad-presets`) has 10 visible plus 2 hidden: Simple UGC, Clean Minimal, Unboxing, Customer Reviews, Viral Chaos, Luxury, Product Story, Cozy Morning, Red Carpet, Elegant Minimal (hidden: Sport Division, General). API: `POST /brand-kits/scrap`, `POST /chains/link-to-ad` (`dry_run=True` returns the credits).

---

## 5. Faceless Studio

Standalone since Aug 20, 2026; before that it was a Supercomputer skill. The agent version also exists as **Faceless channel** in Supercomputer: "up to 15 minutes, 12 visual styles", with AI script, voiceover, 2D animation, music and subtitles.

| | |
|---|---|

## 8. Katana

Launched Oct 8, 2026; blog Oct 12.

Katana is a **Claude skill** that rebuilds a reference edit with your characters, products or clothing through Higgsfield MCP. `higgsfield.ai/katana` prepares the brief and hands it to Claude.

| | |
|---|---|
| Page | Hero "Recreate the edit. Make it yours" / "Powered by Claude Motion". Tabs: Katana presets / Community presets / Explore. How it works: Recreate an edit → Add your content → Make more versions → Create directly in Claude |
| Form | **Add a reference video** ("Upload the edit you want to recreate"; trimmer) · **Add your characters** ("Also you can add other details (optional)"; up to 5 photos per the blog; preset schemas allow 1–10 images) · **Instructions (optional)** toggle ("Describe anything the model should pay attention to when recreating this video"; ≤2,000 characters) → **Send & Generate in Claude**. When the prompt is too long for a link: "Copy this prompt and paste it into a new Claude chat" |
| In Claude | `/katana` opens the catalog, `/katana/<preset>` runs one, or a plain request. Files attached in Claude are not passed through, so Katana opens a Higgsfield upload window; direct media links work, profile links don't |
| Presets | Categories **Personalized edits · Style transfer · Motion transfer**, sources Higgsfield and Community. Live API: 101 community presets (79 personalized edits, 18 style transfer, 4 motion transfer), each with `input_schema {media.images: uuid[1..10], slot_values.prompt ≤2000}`. Launch copy said **Aura Farming, Motion, Clipping**; the hero still reads "Aura-farming machine by Higgsfield & Claude Opus 5.5" |
| Publish preset | A 3–30 s video for the motion, up to 40 images, and a prompt that mentions them with @. It goes live after an automatic check and can be reported (8 reasons) |
| Output | MP4 with the reference's duration, aspect ratio and frame rate. The reference soundtrack is kept unless asked otherwise. The result shows in the chat and in Assets. Job type `katana` (retry and rerun supported) |
| Cost | Plan credits. Claude shows the exact cost before each generation; corrections may add more |

## 9. Virality Predictor

| | |
|---|---|
| Route | `/apps/virality-predictor` ("Viral Potential Predictor"; beta) |
| Job | `brain_activity` (`POST /jobs/v2/brain_activity`); demo `GET /api/hook-predictor/demo-analysis` |
| Input | MP4, MOV or WEBM, ≤200 MB, **≤15 s analysed** ("Select clip — Choose up to 15 seconds to analyze."). Upload from device or pick from your generations |
| How it works | **Drop the clip** (any format, up to 15 s) → **We analyze** ("A modeled audience watches while we map the brain response across vision, sound, memory, attention, language") → **See results** ("a virality score, a peak hook timestamp, a hold rate, and a heatmap…") |
| Result screen | Overall Score · Viral Potential · Hook Score · Hold Rate · Duration · a per-second engagement curve with the video synced ("{t} of {duration}") · **Brain Activity** 3D model (three.js; "Turn on hardware acceleration…") · Global activity · Previous analyses carousel · *Analyze another*. Tagline: "We simulate the cortical response of 720 modeled brains, second by second" |

**Output fields** (from the demo analysis):
- `score`, `viral_potential_score`, `hook_score`, `brain_engagement_score`, each 0–100.
- `verdict` ("Needs work.") and `verdict_tag` ("Below baseline").
- `engagement[]` at 1 Hz, `peak_t`, `peak_val`, `peak_idx`, `mean`, `sustain`.
- `per_frame{region:[…]}`, `regions[]`, `tips[]`.
- `score_details` = {disclaimer "Predictive proxy metrics, not guaranteed performance or clinical measures.", normalization 0..100, `hook_window_seconds` [0,3]}.
- `brainRender {mode: vertex-map, brain GLB, vertex map binary, regionAnchors}`.

**Regions** (all defined on the fsaverage cortical mesh):

| id | Name (short) | Label | Vertex basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| visual_occipital | Visual Cortex (Visual) | Activation | y ≤ −55 |
| frontoparietal_attention | Attention Control (Attention) | Activation | \|x\| ≥ 30, z ≥ 19, y ≥ −55 |
| auditory_temporal | Auditory Cortex (Auditory) | Activation | \|x\| ≥ 38, −55 ≤ y ≤ 10, −30 ≤ z ≤ 25 |
| language_frontotemporal | Language Network (Language) | Activation | lateral temporal (\|x\| ≥ 39, −55 ≤ y ≤ 10, z ≤ 5) or inferior frontal (\|x\| ≥ 15, y ≥ 35, z ≤ 0) |
| default_mode | Focus Drift | **Lower better** (inverted) | medial: \|x\| ≤ 18 and (y ≤ −45 or y ≥ 25) |

**Open model.** Meta's **TRIBE v2** (`facebook/tribev2`, CC BY-NC 4.0, March 2026) predicts fMRI responses to video, audio and text on the **fsaverage5** mesh. It is built from V-JEPA2, Wav2Vec-BERT and Llama-3.2-3B. The fsaverage bases and the "modeled brains" wording strongly suggest Higgsfield runs TRIBE v2 or a derivative *(inferred)*.

## 12. Fuobe today vs this research

| Studio | Fuobe now | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Marketing Studio | Higgsfield `marketing-studio-image` model with a live template picker (image only); prompt apps Ad Creative, Packshot, Poster, Product Placement… | No categories or formats, no product, avatar, hook or setting slots, no brand kit, no video formats, no tools |
| Ads Studio | `ads-studio` model (batch ≤4) | No brand research, products, per-product batches, 3 aspect variants, grid or chat |
| Ad Multiplier | — | Not built |
| Click to Ad / Link to Video Ad | Two apps with parity notes (photo → one creative or one clip) | No URL import, product kit, styles, script or voice |
| Faceless / Explainer | — (the storyboard → film chain is the closest) | Not built |
| Canvas | `/workflows` lists ComfyUI graphs | No in-app node board |
| Katana | — | Not built |
| Virality Predictor | App that only improves the hook frame (parity: "not reproducible") | Now reproducible with TRIBE v2 |
| Assets | `/library`: search, kind filter, favorites | No projects or folders, trash, bulk selection, layouts or filters |
| Supercomputer | `/assist` agent + MCP | No skills catalog, projects or memory |

## 13. Build plan for Fuobe

The order follows reuse: the brand kit and products feed four studios, and the faceless pipeline also feeds Explainer and Katana. Exact model ids per step are in the JSON `fuobe.buildPlan`.

1. **Brand kit + products (M).**
   - Storage: SQLite `brands` (kit JSON) and `products` (name, description, price, audience, ≤5 selling points, url, images).
   - A brand-research job:
     - fetch the HTML and look for Shopify `/products.json`, JSON-LD `Product` and OpenGraph tags;
     - logo from inline SVG, `og:image` or `apple-touch-icon`;
     - colours from CSS custom properties plus k-means over a screenshot;
     - fonts from Google Fonts links, `@font-face` and `font-family`;
     - an LLM fills description, tagline, selling points, aesthetics, tone words, audience, competitors and language: Claude, Ollama, or a rule-based fallback, as in Assist.
   - Reuse Higgsfield's 14 progress labels as rotating step text. No image model is needed, so this works the same in open and paid modes.
2. **Assets library extras (M).**
   - Projects and nested folders with the 7 colour swatches, pins and drag order.
   - Drag-and-drop into folders.
   - A bulk selection bar (Esc clears; zip download, add to folder, like, delete, send to Assist/Canvas).
   - Trash with 30-day restore and Empty trash.
   - Filters: type, activity, date ranges, status, studio.
   - Square, Masonry and List layouts; Split by date; card-size slider; Fill/Fit.
   - All local, both engines.
3. **Marketing Studio (L).**
   - `/marketing`: sidebar (Home, My generations, Favorites, Tools: Product Link and Ad Reference, Projects), hero, the 7 category tabs with All/Images/Videos, and the template masonry.
   - A template opens the composer: Image/Video mode, Product, Avatar, Reference, Website link, hook & setting, settings from capabilities, brand kit, Recreate.
   - Ship **Fuobe's own template set**: names, prompts and preview media written per format; the 9 hooks and 14 settings can be reused as prompt mechanics.
   - On the Higgsfield provider, pass the real `preset_id` / `style_id`.
   - Cloud route:
     - images: `marketing-studio/image`;
     - UGC video: Seedance 2.5 reference-to-video, `fal-ai/creatify/aurora`, `veed/fabric-1.0` or `bytedance/omnihuman/v2`;
     - text-heavy creatives: `ideogram/v4.5` or `recraft-ai/recraft-v4`.
   - Open route:
     - product shots: `qwen-image-edit-2511-multi` (product + avatar), `bg-remove-birefnet`, `relight-qwen-edit-2509`;
     - posters, ads and marketplace: `qwen-image-2512-t2i` for text, plus Qwen-Edit with the template image as a layout reference;
     - motion: `wan22-i2v-14b-lightx2v` or `ltx25-i2v`;
     - UGC: an Ollama script → `tts-chatterbox-multilingual` → avatar-with-product still → `infinitetalk-native` / `wan22-s2v-14b` → `video-concat-*`.
4. **Faceless Studio + Explainer (L).** One chained pipeline:
   1. LLM script;
   2. scenes in 10 s blocks;
   3. a still per block (style preset prompt + LoRA);
   4. a clip per block for *Fully animated*, or a CPU Ken Burns step for *Frame by Frame*;
   5. narration per block (ElevenLabs, or Chatterbox / IndexTTS-2);
   6. a music bed (ElevenLabs Music or ACE-Step);
   7. word-timed subtitles (faster-whisper on CPU, new);
   8. join.
   - Channels store the style, voice, aspect and subtitles.
   - The timeline editor regenerates single blocks.
   - Cloud video per block: `google/gemini-omni-flash/image-to-video`, which is what Higgsfield's skill uses.
5. **Ads Studio (M)** on top of steps 1 and 3.
   - Per-product stepper (1–20); one chained job per ad, with the LLM picking an angle per selling point.
   - One base render, then 1:1, 4:5 and 9:16 by outpainting (`flux1-fill-outpaint`).
   - Headline, CTA and logo composited in code with the brand fonts, so the text is always exact.
   - A creative grid with Split by products.
   - A brand chat that reuses Assist with an `@product` mention.
   - Cloud alternative: `higgsfield/ads-studio/v1.0`.
6. **Ad Multiplier + Click to Ad (M + S).**
   - Ad Multiplier: cloud `bytedance/seedance-2.5/video-edit`, `fal-ai/kling-video/o3/pro/video-to-video/edit` or `google/gemini-omni-flash/v1.1/edit`. Open `wan-animate2` (replace) or `wan21-vace-14b-ref2v` with the reference as control.
   - Hook/CTA only: a new 2–4 s clip from the first or last frame, joined with `fal-ai/ffmpeg-api/merge-videos` or `video-concat-*`, keeping the original audio.
   - Click to Ad becomes the Product Link tool (URL → product kit → style → 9:16 video) and retires the two parity apps.
7. **Supercomputer skills, projects, memory (M).**
   - SKILL.md files loaded into the Assist system prompt on demand (`/skill` or automatic); ship built-ins mirroring §11 and import `.zip` / `.skill`.
   - Projects: Assist threads grouped with instructions, ≤20 sources and project skills.
   - Memory: typed notes the agent can add through a tool, with an Add/Import/Delete page.
8. **Virality Predictor (M).**
   - A Python worker (or custom ComfyUI node) running `facebook/tribev2`: ≤15 s clip → per-second curve, peak second, a hook score over 0–3 s, the 5 region masks from the table in §9, and a verdict. Show a three.js brain.
   - The license is **CC BY-NC**, so the app must say it is for non-commercial use. It needs the gated Llama-3.2-3B.
9. **Katana (L).**
   - Detect cuts → for each shot, swap the subject on a keyframe (`qwen-image-edit-2511-multi`) → regenerate the shot with the reference as motion control (`wan-animate2` / `wan22-fun-control-14b`; cloud: Kling O3 video edit or Genjutsu motion transfer) → join at the original cut times over the original audio.
   - Expose it as an Assist/MCP tool too.
10. **Canvas (XL).**
    - An `@xyflow/react` board with Higgsfield's node set; typed edges (text, image, video, audio); Run node and Run all map to `depends_on` chained jobs, which Fuobe already resolves.
    - Compare = several generator nodes on one prompt; graph JSON autosaved in SQLite; the 5 template graphs.
    - On the open engine, offer "Open in ComfyUI".
