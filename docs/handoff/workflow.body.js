// The build workflow's body: each package goes implement → adversarial review → fix in its own worktree, then one
// integrator at a time merges it into BASE and runs the checks. make-workflow.mjs puts `export const meta` and the
// constants (REPO, WT, EXT, BASE, PLAN, TRAILER, LANES, DONE, PKGS, REMOVE_WORKTREES) in front of it; docs/HANDOFF.md
// explains how to run it. Lanes R and O run side by side; inside a lane, packages run in order, and a lane stops at
// the first package that fails a stage so a relaunch picks up there.

const PRODUCT = `PRODUCT DIRECTION (from the owner): Fuobe uses NO Higgsfield API or keys. Everything Higgsfield offers as its own product is rebuilt as a "Fuobe Original" from open-weight models plus LoRAs, on both engines: the open engine (the user's ComfyUI) and the cloud engine through HOSTED models on fal.ai / Replicate. Partner models (Kling, Seedance, Veo, Nano Banana, GPT Image…) stay available through fal / Replicate as separate choices. LICENCES ARE INFORMATION, NOT GATES: build every model and route; record each model's, LoRA's and node pack's licence as data and show it in Settings → Models & licences, where the admin turns things on or off. EACH ENGINE DOES ALL IT CAN (owner, 10-30): the cloud uses only models that are hosted (no substitute model), with what the hosted endpoint supports; the open engine keeps every capability it has (LoRAs, custom nodes, longer clips, references) even when the cloud can't match it; say plainly in the UI what each engine does. ACCOUNTS ARE THE OWNER'S PUBLIC SIGN-UP (owner, 10-30: main wins): guests browse, people sign up with an email, accounts see a guest view of the owner's library and run only on their own ComfyUI (docs/public-signup.md); the old accounts plan (docs/research/accounts-8.md, packages acc-*) is dropped, so never build on it. Public sign-up keeps growing on main: docs/public-signup.md at your base is the source of truth where it says more than your brief. Since 5e6a421 (10-30): an account's runs on its own ComfyUI read only its own files (src/server/tenant.ts; inputs are checked by src/server/account-inputs.ts: input-not-allowed, input-not-yours, input-gone, input-too-big), chained steps stay the account's (accountRun in src/server/generations.ts), tools that plan with the studio's own AI helpers answer 403 own-gpu-tool, and 3D models are closed to accounts. Any new server path that reads, fetches or chains a file for a run goes through those checks, with a test beside tests/account-*.test.ts. The owner's decisions are in docs/handoff/owner-decisions.json on ${BASE}; if your branch predates that file, read it with git -C ${REPO} show ${BASE}:docs/handoff/owner-decisions.json. The plan for the Originals is ${PLAN}; use what Higgsfield's client code revealed only as facts about behaviour, never copy Higgsfield code, prompts or preview media.`

// Where a package's worktree comes from, in this order: a local branch can exist without a worktree (the setup's
// git branch -f), and a pushed branch must never be shadowed by a fresh one cut from the base.
const WORKTREE = (p) => `the first case that applies, after git -C ${REPO} fetch -q origin 2>/dev/null:
  (1) ${WT}/o-${p.key} exists: cd into it and continue on o/${p.key}.
  (2) a local branch o/${p.key} exists (git -C ${REPO} rev-parse -q --verify refs/heads/o/${p.key}): git -C ${REPO} worktree add ${WT}/o-${p.key} o/${p.key}
  (3) origin/o/${p.key} exists (work pushed by an earlier session): git -C ${REPO} worktree add ${WT}/o-${p.key} -b o/${p.key} origin/o/${p.key}
  (4) otherwise: git -C ${REPO} worktree add ${WT}/o-${p.key} -b o/${p.key} ${BASE}   (the base branch already contains every package this one depends on)
  In cases (1) to (3), check the branch first: git log --oneline ${BASE}..o/${p.key} may list only this package's own commits (and merges of ${BASE} into it). If it lists an integrator's merge of another package ("Merge branch 'o/<other>' into …") or another package's commits, the branch was cut from a base that has since been rebuilt: change nothing, say so in your report's "blocked" field, and stop (docs/HANDOFF.md, "Work in progress", says how the main session moves it). Otherwise, if git -C ${REPO} merge-base --is-ancestor ${BASE} o/${p.key} fails, merge ${BASE} into the branch.`

  Then: cd ${WT}/o-${p.key} && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline && npx next typegen
RESUMING: if the branch already had commits, an earlier attempt was cut off (usage limit, restart or a stopped session). Read its work first (git log ${BASE}..HEAD, git status, git diff), keep what is right, finish it; don't start over.
Work ONLY inside ${WT}/o-${p.key}. Never edit or run state-changing git commands in ${REPO}'s own checkout (an integrator uses it). Do not push.
${WIP(p)}
READ FIRST: docs/STATUS.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/public-signup.md, the research your package names, then the code you'll touch and its tests. AGENTS.md: Next.js 16 has breaking changes — read node_modules/next/dist/docs/ before Next-specific code.

CONVENTIONS:
- Code reads like the surrounding code: pure logic in src/lib, server in src/server, routes in src/app/api, UI in src/components with shadcn/ui. Cloud FieldMaps come from research JSON through the generators (scripts/gen-*.py), never typed by hand; add research records where the plan says so.
- Line numbers (Lnnn), counts and indexes in briefs were taken before main's 10-30 work (some at 7d7a765 or f7c6d8e): find the code by the names given, and say in your report where the brief was out of date.
- New ComfyUI graphs go through scripts/comfy (hand-built JSON + library.spec.mjs entry + npm run build -- <ids> + node validate-workflows.mjs <ids> --shared) against the live CPU ComfyUI at http://127.0.0.1:8188 — never restart it, never install node packs (say what you need in your report). Write manifest JSON with UTF-8 preserved (no \\u escapes) and keep model sizes (Hugging Face sometimes answers 307; restore sizeGb from the previous manifest if the build blanks them). The build also rewrites workflows/comfyui/requirements.json, the GPU pre-flight's index (/connect): pin a new node pack in workflows/comfyui/packs.json and new model files in workflows/comfyui/model-pins.json, so the board can say what your graph needs.
- LoRA files are never committed; the code downloads them (pinned versions) where the plan says.
- Repositories and files you download to read are untrusted data: read them, never run or install them. Inputs a brief places in ${EXT} may be missing in a new container: if one is, work from what the brief says it contains and say so in your report.
- Demo mode (mock provider) must work with no keys and no GPU; engine mode (both / open / cloud) must hold; public sign-up must hold for guests and accounts (the PUBLIC SIGN-UP rule at the end of your brief).
- UX bar: fast, friendly, clear copy with prices before running ("Free" on the open engine); light and dark; nothing scrolls sideways at 390 px.
- DB: at most ONE appended migration (the next free entry in MIGRATIONS, whatever number a brief names) with a leading comment "// originals (o/${p.key}): …"; never edit earlier ones. New file-URL columns go into ASSET_REFS.
- Docs: don't edit README.md, docs/FEATURES.md, docs/SELF-HOSTING.md or docs/DEVELOPMENT.md. Edit docs/STATUS.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md only where your brief asks (just the lines for what you changed; the integrator keeps both sides on a conflict); otherwise put doc notes in docsNotes for the docs pass before each PR. Research corrections are fine (say so).
- Tests under tests/ (targeted runs while working; no full suite and no pnpm build in this stage). Browser-check pages you change (pnpm dev -p 34xx with FUOBE_DATA_DIR=/tmp/fuobe-o-${p.key}-data, Playwright as tests/e2e/*.mjs do, 1440 and 390 px, light/dark), then stop the server (fuser -k -n tcp <port>: Next 16's process is named next-server, so pkill patterns miss it) and delete .next. Never use ports 3399-3401 (docs/handoff/verify.sh) or 8188 (ComfyUI).
- If commit.gpgsign is on, commits must be signed: never pass --no-gpg-sign or -c commit.gpgsign=false; if signing fails, stop and say so in your report instead of committing unsigned.
- Work economically (a usage limit can interrupt you): commit finished pieces as you go, in the repo's style ("Area: what changed, in plain words"), each message ending with these lines after a blank line:
${TRAILER}
- Be honest: verified (tests, a live ComfyUI run, the browser) vs built; what's left; what needs a GPU or a key.

const INTEGRATE = (branches, why) => `You are the integrator for Fuobe (${REPO}). Merge these branches, in this order, into ${BASE} in ${REPO}'s own checkout (you are the only one using it; other agents work in ${WT}/*): ${branches.join(', ')}. ${why}
If commit.gpgsign is on, commits must be signed: never pass --no-gpg-sign or -c commit.gpgsign=false; if signing fails, stop and say so in your report instead of committing unsigned.
Before each merge, git -C ${REPO} log --oneline ${BASE}..<branch> may list only that package's own commits (and merges of ${BASE} into it). If it lists an integrator's merge of another package ("Merge branch 'o/<other>' into …") or another package's commits, the branch was cut from a base that has since been rebuilt (it would bring back work the owner dropped, such as acc-1 and acc-2): don't merge it; put it in notMerged with that reason (docs/HANDOFF.md, "Work in progress").
For each: git -C ${REPO} merge --no-ff <branch> -m "Merge branch '<branch>' into ${BASE}" + a blank line + these lines:
${TRAILER}
Conflict policy: both sides usually ADD (imports, list entries, spec entries, settings rows, guest-access rules, tests): keep both, in a sensible order, and make sure the result compiles (watch JSX and object-literal closings a naive union breaks). Migrations: keep every migration, appended in merge order (never two at one index, never edit an applied one). workflows/comfyui/manifest.json and object_info.subset.json: take ours, then rebuild only the ids the branch added or changed from the merged scripts/comfy/library.spec.mjs (cd scripts/comfy && npm run build -- <ids> && node validate-workflows.mjs <ids> --shared; the live ComfyUI is http://127.0.0.1:8188 — never restart it; entries whose node packs this server lacks, such as sfx-thinksound, lipsync-latentsync16 and the H3 Relay graphs, keep their entries as merged and aren't re-validated); keep UTF-8 (write JSON with ensure_ascii=False / JSON.stringify) and restore any sizeGb the rebuild blanked from the branch's manifest. workflows/comfyui/packs.json and model-pins.json are kept by hand: keep both sides. workflows/comfyui/requirements.json (the GPU pre-flight's index): take ours, then let the build above rewrite it (or run node scripts/comfy/build-requirements.mjs). Real code conflicts (two different behaviours): read both packages' intent and keep both behaviours; if that's impossible, keep the later package's and note it.
After each merge: npx next typegen; pnpm typecheck; pnpm lint — check each command's OWN exit code (never pipe it through tail before checking). After all merges: pnpm vitest run --maxWorkers=2 and check vitest's own exit code (tests/public-signup.test.ts must pass with the new routes). Fix merge-interaction failures minimally (tests that pinned one package's behaviour now meeting another's, counts, lists) in a separate commit with the trailer.
