/**
 * Media and data for Home's first screen (src/components/home/home-bento.tsx): the video tile's reel of clips and its
 * poster, the 3D tile's clip and its poster, each in several widths, and AVIF copies of pictures the site already
 * publishes (the Audio tile's two photos among them, from Clean up voice's demo). Nothing is rendered: every file is a
 * copy of a published picture or of the full-size render a published clip was cut from, so the tiles show exactly what
 * the studios show, only sharper.
 *
 * Output (public/previews/home/):
 *   reel-<name>-{640,1024}.mp4                each clip of the video tile's reel (REEL), and at 1536 and 2048 where its
 *                                             2048 px master is in the masters folder
 *   reel-sand-storm-<width>.avif              the reel's first clip's first frame at each of its widths: the tile's poster
 *   rotation-{640,1024,1536,2048}.{mp4,avif}  the turning gown (the 3D tile) at four widths, and each one's first frame
 *   reel-sand-storm-1024.jpg, rotation-1024.jpg the 1024 px clips' first frames, for a browser without AVIF
 *   voice-{room,quiet}-{480,768,1024}.avif  Clean up voice's demo photos (public/samples/clean-voice/): the restaurant,
 *                                         and the same photo softened around her, which the Audio tile shows once the
 *                                         noise is off; voice-{room,quiet}-1024.jpg for a browser without AVIF
 *   genjutsu-<name>-{640,768,1024}.mp4    each clip of the Genjutsu tile's reel (WIPES): a swap shown as it happens, the
 *                                         original clip and the swapped one under a divider that sweeps across them
 *   genjutsu-couple-{640,768,1024}.avif   the reel's first clip's first frame at each width: the tile's poster
 *   genjutsu-couple-1024.jpg              the 1024 px clip's first frame, for a browser without AVIF
 *   genjutsu-couple-split-{640,768,1024}.avif  a frame of that clip split down the middle (original | swapped): the
 *                                         tile's still under reduced motion
 *   board-{photo,film}.webp               the Canvas board's photo and a frame of its film, 168 px squares
 * and src/lib/home-bento.generated.ts: each file's content version, the reel (its clips in order, each one's length and
 * framing, and where set how long it holds its last frame and fades out), the Genjutsu reel (each clip's labels and
 * where its divider is on every frame), and each poster's mean colour.
 *
 * The reel: the video tile plays these clips one after another, each once, and crossfades into the next (after the
 * last, back to the first). Each is a stretch of its preset's full-size render: `from` (its first frame in the render)
 * and `frames` long, at CLIP_FPS, with no loop of its own. The 3D tile's clip is the published clip's own cut
 * (scripts/eval/lib/covers.mjs: its first CLIP_SECONDS at CLIP_FPS, looped the same way), made again from the full-size
 * render instead of the 512 px copy. All are H.264 High (a CRF per clip and width, faststart, no sound), tagged BT.709
 * so every browser shows their colours the same way. Each tile picks the width its box needs on the screen it is on
 * (bento-islands.tsx).
 *
 * The posters: the reel's first clip's and the 3D clip's own first frame, decoded from the encoded file the way a
 * browser shows it (BT.709, limited range), at POSTER_QUALITY: the tile shows it until its clip plays, and the clip
 * takes over on that same frame, so the swap can't be seen. They are made again from the clips on every run, with or without masters.
 *
 * Masters: the full-size renders are not in the repo. With --masters <dir> (or FUOBE_HOME_MASTERS) the clips, their
 * posters and the before/after copies are made from the files in it:
 *   <dir>/<preset>.mp4             the full-size render each reel clip and the 3D clip are cut from (1024 x 768, 24 fps)
 *   <dir>/<preset>-2048.mkv        the same render upscaled to 2048 x 1536, every frame (SeedVR2 7B, lossless FFV1,
 *                                  BT.709), for the 1536 and 2048 px copies: the 3D clip needs it; a reel clip without
 *                                  one comes at 640 and 1024 only
 *   <dir>/genjutsu-<name>-swap.mp4      each Genjutsu clip's swapped take as the model made it (24 fps)
 *   <dir>/genjutsu-<name>-original.mp4  the clip it was made from, as it went in
 * Without it those files are kept as they are (and versioned; a reel clip in the widths it has), the posters are made
 * again from the clips kept, and so is the rest.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/gen-home-bento.mjs            make every file and the generated module
 *      node scripts/gen-home-bento.mjs --dry-run  make and measure, write nothing
 * Needs ffmpeg on PATH (or FUOBE_FFMPEG).
