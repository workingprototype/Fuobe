# Tencent AuK (Audio → Edit speech and AuK speech, nm10-speech-edit; MIT code and weights): ComfyUI-AuK is the comfyui
# folder of Tencent-Hunyuan/AuK, which imports the auk package from the same checkout. So the whole repository is cloned
# beside custom_nodes at the pinned commit, installed editable with its [comfyui] extra, and the node folder linked into
# custom_nodes; its relative model paths (ckpts/...) then resolve inside that checkout. Opt-in, since the weights are about
# 19 GB and it wants a 24 GB+ NVIDIA GPU (17 GB with the loader's cpu_offload): AUK=1. AUK_WEIGHTS=1 also downloads
# AuK-Flash and the Qwen2.5-Omni-3B encoder into AuK/ckpts (AUK_BASE=1 adds the 32-step base model). The Prompt Enhancer
# stays off in Fuobe's graphs, so no LLM_* variables are needed.
