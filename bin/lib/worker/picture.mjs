// Pictures for the worker's ComfyUI (docs/gpu-workers.md). Every picture of an account's job ticket, and of a finishing
// job, is made again from its pixels before anything on this PC reads it: turned upright by its EXIF orientation, then
// written as a fresh PNG with nothing else of the file (no EXIF, no GPS, no XMP, no colour profile's text, no comment).
// Only one short-lived process at low priority ever reads the picture as it came (picture-child.mjs, with sharp), with
// a cap on its pixels and a time limit. The studio sends an account's pictures as they came, so this is the only place
// they are decoded.
