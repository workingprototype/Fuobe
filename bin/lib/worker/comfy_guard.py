"""The guard of a Fuobe worker's own ComfyUI (docs/gpu-workers.md).

The worker starts its ComfyUI through this file instead of main.py:

    python comfy_guard.py <ComfyUI>/main.py --listen 127.0.0.1 --port <port> ...

It reads the key the worker made for this start (FUOBE_WORKER_GUARD_KEY, then removes it from the environment), puts
a check in front of every aiohttp application ComfyUI makes, and runs main.py as ComfyUI's own start does. The check
answers 403 to any request whose Host is not exactly 127.0.0.1:<port>, or that does not carry the key in
X-Fuobe-Worker-Key. A web page that points its own name at 127.0.0.1 (DNS rebinding) sends neither, so it reaches
nothing.

Some routes answer 403 to every request, with the key or without (BLOCKED_ROUTES): routes a node pack can add that the
worker never uses, refused under ComfyUI's /api prefix too.

One request needs no key: GET /fuobe-worker/hello with X-Fuobe-Worker-Challenge (16 to 128 hex digits). The answer is
the challenge signed with the key (HMAC-SHA-256), this process's id and its parent's (a venv's python.exe on Windows
starts the real Python as a child of its own). The worker checks both before it sends the key, so a program that took
the port first never learns it.

The worker starts this file in Python's isolated mode (-I), so its own folder is never on the import path. That mode
also ignores PYTHONIOENCODING, which this file applies to its output itself.

Only the Python standard library and aiohttp (which ComfyUI needs anyway).
