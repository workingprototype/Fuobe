// `fuobe worker run`: the worker's loop (docs/gpu-workers.md). It beats to the studio, keeps its own ComfyUI running
// only while it may work, takes one job at a time with the same runner the browser uses, checks each graph itself,
// cleans up after each job, and pauses itself when another program uses the GPU.
//
// It also keeps jobs going through trouble: finished results stay on its disk until the studio has them (hold.mjs), so a
// stop before the upload never runs a job twice; every call to the studio follows one retry policy (retry.mjs); a job
// that stalls or runs past its run limit goes back to the line and a stuck ComfyUI is started again; a ComfyUI that ran
// out of memory is freed and the job sent once more; a job its ComfyUI stopped on twice fails, not the worker; inputs are
// read from the studio once and every clip and sound is made again by ffmpeg (media.mjs); the PC stays awake while it
// holds a job or waits for one (awake.mjs); and it looks at its model folders again every 10 minutes.
//
// Studio jobs first (turns.mjs, local-work.mjs): with a turns folder set, local ComfyUI work on the PC is told apart
// from other programs. Another program still pauses the worker as before. Local ComfyUI work instead gets a request for
// a turn, and the worker waits for the answer with its jobs kept in their place.
//
// The CPU slot (worker.json `cpuSlot: true`): beside its GPU's job it runs one CPU task at a time, claimed for itself:
// light CPU work (joins, trims, adding sound, loops, Ken Burns, filters) on a second ComfyUI of its own that runs on the
// CPU only, and finishing jobs (finish.mjs: the 3D finish, camera paths) with its own code. Every picture of an account's
// job is made again from its pixels before anything reads it (picture.mjs).
//
// The text slot (worker.json `textSlot`, text.mjs): the studio's free text helper, answered by a llama.cpp server the
// worker starts itself, on the GPU when there is room, else on the CPU. Its memory counts as the worker's own.
